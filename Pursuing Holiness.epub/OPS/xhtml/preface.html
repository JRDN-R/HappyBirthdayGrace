<h2 class="h2a"><b><a id="page_7"></a>Preface</b></h2>
<p class="bodytext">Since the release of David K. Bernard&#8217;s<i> In Search of Holiness</i> and<i> Practical Holiness,</i> over 150,000 of his works on holiness have been distributed. The sincere, balanced voice of this trusted author and leader continues to provide direction to Christians in our search to understand how to live a life pleasing to God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This new volume is a compilation of<i> In Search of Holiness </i>and<i> Practical Holiness,</i> following the author&#8217;s direction. It presents a revised study of selected material from each volume. Discussion questions are included at the end of each chapter for use in a group setting or for reflection in personal study. The author has recorded a series of video introductions to help make this volume suited for small group study.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As with the previous volumes, you can trust this book to provide carefully researched biblical evidence for holiness, and as such it is a valued new addition to the Word Aflame Press collection and now for your library as well.</p>
