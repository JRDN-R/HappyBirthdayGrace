<h4 class="h4-a"><a id="ch23"/><a href="contents.html#ch23"><b>Discussion Questions</b></a></h4>
<p class="hang1"><i>1. How does something as simple as the food we eat reflect a commitment to holiness?</i></p>
<p class="hang1"><i>2. Describe how the principle of separation from the world factors in when we consider the Christian&#8217;s stance on alcoholic beverages.</i></p>
<p class="hang1"><i>3. Our culture has very open policies about acceptable sexual practices, yet God&#8217;s Word specifically limits this to the role of husband and wife. Why do you think God so designed it?</i></p>
<p class="hang1"><i>4. Given God&#8217;s clear view of homosexuality and yet our biblical directive to be kind as Christians, what is the proper response when we are confronted by homosexuality in the media, in the workplace, and with family members?</i></p>
<p class="hang1">5. <i><a id="page_194"></a>The values and practical applications of holiness we have studied go against much of what our contemporary society promotes. How do we embrace separation and communicate our beliefs with a loving spirit?</i></p>
<p class="hang1">6. <i>As a result of all the sessions combined, put your personal statement of commitment to holiness in a single sentence.</i></p>
