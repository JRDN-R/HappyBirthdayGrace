<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_127"></a><i>&#8220;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array&#8221; (I Timothy 2:9).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD</span> thy God&#8221; (Deuteronomy 22:5).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1">Outward appearance is an important aspect of holiness. The Bible teaches Christians how to dress and how to adorn themselves, giving principles that govern the outward appearance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It is important to understand principles in this area for at least two reasons. First, styles of dress and customs have changed since the days of the Bible, so we must apply its teachings to situations unknown in that day. Second, few statements in the New Testament specifically deal with men&#8217;s appearance, since men&#8217;s adornment was generally not a problem in those days. By identifying principles, we can apply the teaching to both men and women. Thus, in this chapter we discuss five scriptural principles for adornment and dress.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_128"></a>Modesty</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">We begin by recognizing the fundamental principle that Christians are to be modest in their appearance (I Timothy 2:9). The Greek word for &#8220;modest&#8221; is<i> kosmios,</i> which means orderly, well-arranged, decent, modest. Here it describes someone who is decent or chaste, especially in outward dress and deportment. In explaining how women should adorn themselves, the apostle Peter explained that wives can win their unsaved husbands by their chaste conduct (I Peter 3:2). Modesty is particularly important when we appear in public in view of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the beginning, God created Adam and Eve in a state of innocence, and it seems that they were clothed with His glory. (See Genesis 2:25; Psalm 8:5.) Their relationship of physical, mental, and spiritual union was pure. When they sinned against God by eating fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they lost God&#8217;s glory, realized they were naked, and tried to clothe themselves with fig leaves. The pure relationship between man and woman was now capable of being distorted and polluted by sin, especially as the human race multiplied. Thus, God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins to cover their nakedness (Genesis 3:21). Since that time, it has been His plan for humans to be decently clothed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The devil tries to do just the opposite to humans. One of the things the demon-possessed man of Gadara did was take off his clothes. When Jesus cast out the demons, the man was found fully clothed and in his right mind (Luke 8:27, 35).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Immodest apparel can indicate the presence of a lustful spirit&#8212;a desire to flaunt the body and to attract the opposite sex by lust. Immodesty is a strong temptation and enticement, especially for men, who are more visually oriented and more easily aroused than women. David fell into adultery because of the lust of the eyes (II Samuel 11:2). It is easy for a man to sin in his heart by <a id="page_129"></a>looking at an immodestly clothed woman (Matthew 5:28). In such a case the man is guilty, but the woman is not completely innocent either. God&#8217;s plan for us today is to dress modestly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Modest apparel means clothing that does not indecently expose the body to the opposite sex, whether intentionally or carelessly. In this regard, we should be mindful of sleeve length, necklines, dress length, tight clothes, and thin clothes. Both men and women need to develop a personal sense of modesty, wearing clothing that is appropriate to the occasion&#8212;whether sitting or standing, remaining still or praising God joyfully. For example, to implement the principle of modesty under various circumstances, we recommend that sleeves cover the upper arm and that dresses cover the knee.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Avoiding Personal Ornamentation</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The word<i> modest</i> also has the connotation of not being showy or flashy. A woman should adorn herself with &#8220;shamefacedness and sobriety&#8221; and not with personal ornaments such as elaborately arranged hair (particularly braiding jewelry into the hair), gold, pearls, or extremely costly garments (I Timothy 2:9). &#8220;Shamefacedness&#8221; means reverence, self-restraint, modesty, and bashfulness. &#8220;Sobriety&#8221; means discretion, temperance, and self-control.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In short, Christians are not to dress in a vain way. God hates pride (see chapter 5), and He does not approve of a pretentious or ostentatious display. Styles primarily designed to feed the ego are not appropriate. Women should not rely on outward adorning to establish their identity. &#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price&#8221; (I Peter 3:3-4).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_130"></a>It is acceptable to &#8220;adorn&#8221; oneself with &#8220;modest apparel.&#8221; There is nothing wrong with ornamental aspects of clothing&#8212; such as colors, patterns, buttons, bows, scarves, and ties&#8212;as long as they remain in moderation. Clothing should be primarily functional and only secondarily ornamental. However, Scripture specifically instructs us not to adorn ourselves with precious stones and metals. This teaching forbids ornamental jewelry, whether real or imitation.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Moderation in Cost</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Closely associated with the avoidance of ornaments is the principle of moderation in cost. For this reason, we are not to adorn ourselves with gold, pearls, or &#8220;costly array.&#8221; The definition of costly clothing may vary somewhat depending on the culture, society, and income of the individual. A good test is to ask if certain clothing would be an ostentatious display of wealth in the sight of acquaintances and fellow believers. Would it unduly arouse envy? Would it represent good stewardship of the money God has entrusted to our care? Surely it grieves God to see His people buying extravagant clothing, jewelry, and automobiles while they neglect His kingdom and His work suffers in many areas. God has blessed America materially, and He has blessed many Christians financially. He wants us to use our prosperity to support efforts to win the lost and to help the needy, not merely to satisfy our own desires.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Distinction between Male and Female</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Deuteronomy 22:5 states another important concept to God: distinction between male and female. Not only are there biological differences between genders, but there are mental <a id="page_131"></a>and emotional differences as well. In addition, God has established certain social methods for maintaining the distinction between male and female&#8212;namely, dress and hair length. (See chapter 9.) This separation is important to God because He has designed different roles in life for the male and the female. In society, this distinction is an important guard against homosexuality, which God hates. (See chapter 11.) The principle of gender distinction in dress is violated by unisex clothing, by men dressing in a feminine way, and by women dressing in a masculine way.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Many argue that Deuteronomy 22:5 does not apply today. Some say that since both sexes wore robes in Bible days there was no clear distinction. While it is true that both wore robes, it is also true that there were clear differences in the types of robes worn by males and those worn by females. This fact is evident from a study of the history and culture of the Middle East as well as from the existence of this teaching in Deuteronomy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another objection is that Deuteronomy 22:5 is part of the law given to Israel and does not concern us as Christians. For instance, today we do not literally obey verses 9-11, which prohibit mixing of seed when sowing, plowing with an ox and a donkey yoked together, and weaving wool and linen together in one garment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">To answer this objection, we must rightly divide the Word of God by looking at what these verses are intended to teach us. Verse 5 teaches the distinction of gender, which is a moral law. It was not instituted just for Israel, but it originated with creation and is still relevant today. Verses 9-11 teach the principle of separation, using physical objects as types of spiritual separation. Today, we do not obey the ceremonial aspects of the law as found in verses 9-11, but we do fulfill them in typology. Our separation today is not between kinds of seeds, animals, and fibers but between holy and unholy, spiritual and carnal.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_132"></a>We clearly see the difference in the two types of law, moral and ceremonial, in this chapter because verse 5 uses the word<i> abomination</i> but verses 9-11 do not. Specifically, verse 5 says that it is an &#8220;abomination unto the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD</span> thy God&#8221; for a person to wear clothes pertaining to the opposite sex. An abomination is something hated or detested, so verse 5 speaks of something that God hates.</p>
<p class="bodytext">God does not change in His likes and dislikes, for He has declared, &#8220;I am the Lord, I change not&#8221; (Malachi 3:6). God has &#8220;repented,&#8221; or changed His mind, about whether to execute judgment, depending on people&#8217;s repentance, but His basic character does not change. He is absolute in holiness and in His hatred of sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Thus, God&#8217;s people of all ages must shun what is an abomination to Him. Christians do not need to keep the purely ceremonial part of the Jewish law, for it has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ. (See Colossians 2:16-17.) The ceremonial law did not relate to things God hated but to specific methods of worship and specific marks of identification. In some cases, God designated things as an abomination to Israel&#8212;that is, something the Israelites were supposed to hate&#8212;but refrained from calling them abominations to Him. As an example, God told Israel that certain animals were abominations to them and unclean to them (Leviticus 11). They were not called abominations to God or to us today. Wearing clothes of the opposite sex is an abomination to God, however, so it is an abomination to God&#8217;s people of every age. In this connection, we should note that no abomination will enter the New Jerusalem but will be cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 21:8, 27).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The New Testament shows that God still considers distinction of gender to be important. According to I Corinthians 11, men should have short hair while women should have long hair. (See chapter 9.) According to I Corinthians 6:9-10, the &#8220;effeminate&#8221; will not inherit the kingdom of God. This passage uses two Greek words to describe homosexual activity. <a id="page_133"></a>The one translated as &#8220;effeminate&#8221; is<i> malakos,</i> which has the connotation of being soft and effeminate. While the focus is on the sin of homosexuality, part of the problem is that some men act and dress like women.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not only is Deuteronomy 22:5 timeless, it applies to all cultures. &#8220;That which pertaineth unto a man&#8221; means clothing traditionally associated with men or patterned after men&#8217;s clothing. The type of clothing may vary with culture. For example, in Scotland the kilt was traditionally a man&#8217;s garment, and in some parts of Asia and the Pacific, men wear similar garments. If a certain type of garment has been traditionally and culturally used exclusively by one gender and it is different from similar garments worn by the opposite sex, then it is permissible for the one sex to wear and not for the other sex.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In Western culture, the distinctive clothing of men is pants, and the distinctive clothing of women is dresses and skirts. Although cultural views are changing to allow certain unisex fashions, when Westerners emphasize masculine versus feminine dress they fall back on this distinction. For instance, the doors of public restrooms often have a silhouette of a man in pants and a woman in a dress. The practice of women wearing pants did not gain widespread acceptance in America until World War II. At that time women began to take men&#8217;s places in factories, as the men went off to war. Around this time, it also became widely accepted for women to cut their hair, smoke cigarettes, and drink alcoholic beverages. When society was disrupted and women assumed men&#8217;s roles, then it became acceptable for women to wear pants&#8212;first for factory work, then for informal occasions, and finally for general public use, including office and church.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Today, most women wear pants sometimes, yet on formal occasions or occasions when they wish to accentuate their femininity, they usually wear dresses. Few men, however, will wear a dress. Indeed, most denominational Christians would <a id="page_134"></a>disapprove of a man wearing a dress. For example, most would not accept a male pastor who wears a dress in the pulpit. Yet, from the scriptural viewpoint, both actions should be treated in a similar manner.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Although some pants are designed for women, typically they are closely patterned after men&#8217;s clothing and would still fit under the definition of &#8220;that which pertaineth unto a man.&#8221; &#8220;To pertain&#8221; means to belong to as a part, attribute, feature, or function; to have reference; to relate. In many cases, women wear styles that are exactly the same as men&#8217;s styles, such as jeans, military fatigues, and sweat pants. When pants are designed for women, they can be quite form fitting and revealing, and if so they violate the principle of modesty in addition to the key principle of gender distinction.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Separation from the World</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Another important principle of outward holiness is separation from the world. God visibly separated the Israelites from the rest of the nations by their food, dress, farming practices, worship ceremonies, and Sabbath rest. It was usually possible to identify Jews simply by observing their dress and actions. As a result of their unique identity, the Jews have survived as the only ancient biblical people to maintain their cultural and religious heritage.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Egyptians today do not have the same culture, religion, or language as in the days of the pharaohs. The Persians, Syrians, Greeks, and Romans do not have their ancient cultural, religious, and political systems. Most other tribes and nations that coexisted with Israel&#8212;such as the Hittites, Babylonians, Edomites, Assyrians, Philistines, and Ammonites&#8212;have not even survived as distinct nations. Yet the Jews have maintained their cultural identity through Babylonian captivity, Roman occupation, and nineteen hundred years without a <a id="page_135"></a>homeland. The reason is that God&#8217;s laws separated them from other nations and preserved their identity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Similarly, for Christians to exist as a chosen people, they must have points of separation, both external and internal. In relation to dress and adornment, God has not given us arbitrary commands, but He has chosen points of distinction that also achieve His other objectives of modesty, moderation, humility, and gender differentiation. Consequently, Christian guidelines for conduct and dress help us remain separate from the world around us. They help distance us from temptation and sin, and they help us maintain our identity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Because of this principle of separation, Christians sometimes avoid certain activities, hairstyles, and clothing that do not violate specific scriptural statements but nevertheless are closely associated with worldly attitudes and behavior. In another culture and time they might be permissible, but if they identify us with an ungodly lifestyle in our society, then we avoid them. For instance, if a certain style of adornment or dress is closely associated with sexual promiscuity, homosexuality, or pagan religion, then Christians avoid it. As an example, the hippies of the 1960s used their hair and dress to express rebellion and sexual permissiveness, so Christians avoided looking like them. Similarly, the communist Chinese used unisex Mao suits as a symbol of their political and social views.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We must exercise caution in following the latest fads and fashions of the world. It is not wrong to follow fashions as long as they are consistent with biblical principles. However, we do not want to become closely identified with a worldly spirit, nor do we want to get caught up in a spirit of competition. Instead, we want to be examples of modesty, moderation, humility, and holiness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Our dress should be appropriate to the occasion. Good taste and custom can guide us in this matter. When finances prohibit someone from being well dressed, there is certainly <a id="page_136"></a>no question of holiness. We should not treat a poorly dressed person any different from a rich, well-dressed person, but we should be kind and accepting of both (James 2:1-9). Even in cases of poverty, however, Christians can strive to be clean and neat. We are ambassadors of Christ, so we should represent Him as well as possible.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In short, our outward appearance tells others much about our lifestyle, beliefs, and attitudes. We should ask if our appearance is a good witness of Christianity. Does it identify us with rebellion? Could it be a stumbling block to others? Or is it an example of godliness both to unbelievers and believers?</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Makeup</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Christian woman are encouraged to adorn themselves&#8212; that is, to present themselves as neat, clean, and attractive&#8212; but they must do so with &#8220;shamefacedness and sobriety&#8221; (I Timothy 2:9). &#8220;Shamefacedness&#8221; means respect, reverence, self-restraint, modesty, or bashfulness toward men; not being bold or forward.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Colored makeup and tattoos are contrary to the principle of avoiding personal ornamentation and vanity. Makeup is obviously designed to attract the opposite sex. It does so by accentuating sensuality in the woman and arousing lust in the man. The application of makeup is not arbitrary, but much of it originated as an imitation of a woman&#8217;s appearance during sexual arousal. Thus, both in the Old Testament and throughout history, painting the face is associated with brazenness, forwardness, seduction, and prostitution.</p>
<p class="bodytext">According to history, painting of the eyelids to enhance sexual appeal was first introduced in ancient Egypt about 3000<span class="smallcaps"> BC.</span> Proverbs 6:25 refers to this practice: &#8220;Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her <a id="page_137"></a>eyelids.&#8221; The surrounding verses speak of this woman as &#8220;evil,&#8221; &#8220;strange,&#8221; &#8220;whorish,&#8221; and an &#8220;adulteress.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">A prominent example occurs in II Kings 9:30. Jehu was anointed king of Israel and given the mission of destroying the family of Ahab, who hated God&#8217;s Word. Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, heard that Jehu was coming and tried to seduce him in order to save her own life. As a means of enticing him, she painted her face or eyes and adorned her head. When Jehu arrived, he discerned her strategy and ordered her to be killed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Esther, the woman who saved her nation, stands in sharp contrast to Jezebel. The young women who appeared before the Persian king made preparations with oils and perfumes. When they went before the king, they could ask for anything else that they wanted to assist them, and no doubt they chose various cosmetics and ornaments. When Esther&#8217;s turn came, she asked for nothing but relied on the advice of the king&#8217;s chamberlain who had charge of the women. (See Esther 2:13-15.) She wanted to be accepted for who she was, and she relied on the will of the Lord.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In Jeremiah 4:30, God compared the backslidden nation of Judah to a woman who tried to appeal to her lovers with makeup and ornaments. Ezekiel 23:36-44 similarly describes Samaria and Jerusalem (the capitals of Israel and Judah) as two women who adorned themselves with makeup and jewelry in order to commit adultery with a variety of lovers. In both cases, God associated makeup with sexual immorality. Nowhere does the Bible associate makeup with a virtuous woman.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In American society before the twentieth century, women generally did not wear makeup, and those who did were considered to be immoral. According to<i> Encyclopedia Britannica, </i>it was not until after World War I that makeup became generally acceptable, and even then its use was limited until after World War II. Most conservative churches did not approve of it until that time.Of course, most women today who wear <a id="page_138"></a>makeup do not have the intention of being immoral but are simply conforming to culture. Nevertheless, these passages of Scripture reveal what God thinks about ornamental makeup. When we abstain from makeup and tattoos, we please Him.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Ornamental Jewelry</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Wearing ornamental jewelry violates the principle of avoiding personal ornamentation and the principle of moderation in cost. Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, both the apostle Paul and the apostle Peter addressed this aspect of adornment. &#8220;To adorn&#8221; means to decorate, ornament, beautify, or embellish. According to I Timothy 2:9-10, women are to adorn themselves in modest clothing and with good works, but not with &#8220;broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.&#8221; Similarly, I Peter 3:3-4 says their adorning should be with &#8220;the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price&#8221;; it should not be &#8220;that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">These two passages support each other. Both warn against braided or plaited hair, which refers to the elaborate hair arrangement of that time, particularly to the intertwining of pearls and gold thread in the hair. Both warn against ornamental jewelry, both using the example of a precious metal and one using the example of a precious stone. Both warn against extravagant clothing; the &#8220;outward adorning . . . of putting on of apparel&#8221; in I Peter refers to clothing worn as excessive ornamentation instead of for practical reasons of modesty and protection from the elements.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While the foregoing New Testament passages provide the most complete and relevant teaching on adornment for <a id="page_139"></a>Christians today, God sought to introduce similar principles in the Old Testament.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In Exodus 33:1-11, the Israelites had just sinned by making a golden calf and worshiping it. God had promised to lead them personally into the land of Canaan, but His justice now compelled Him not to appear in their midst lest He consume them. In His mercy, God promised to send an angel to lead them instead. When the people heard this, they began to mourn. As a sign of their sorrow and their repentance, they did not put on their ornaments. The Lord told them they were a stubborn people and instructed, &#8220;Put off thy ornaments from thee.&#8221; In response, they &#8220;stripped themselves of their ornaments.&#8221; They needed to strip themselves of their vanity in the presence of God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Moses then walked toward the Tabernacle, and all the people stood in the doors of their tents to watch. As a result of their consecration, the Lord came down in a cloud of glory. All the people worshiped Him, and He talked to Moses as a friend. The stripping of unnecessary ornaments had demonstrated that the Israelites really wanted the presence of God. It was a lesson in self-denial and humility. Likewise, if we want the fullness of God&#8217;s presence and a close relationship with Him as a body of believers, we need to make this type of consecration.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Isaiah 3:16-26 describes the vanity of wearing ornaments. The nation of Judah had become proud, which displeased God. Consequently, He said He would remove all their ornaments. The passage lists the ornaments and expensive apparel that displayed their pride. (Definitions are from Strong&#8217;s<i> Concordance </i>or from the New King James Version where indicated.) They were tinkling ornaments for the feet, cauls (netting for the hair), round tires like the moon (round pendants for the neck, or &#8220;crescents&#8221; in NKJV), chains (pendants for the ear), bracelets, mufflers (long veils), bonnets (headdresses), ornaments for the legs, headbands, tablets (&#8220;perfume boxes&#8221; in NKJV), earrings <a id="page_140"></a>(or &#8220;charms&#8221; in NKJV), rings, nose jewels, changeable suits of apparel (&#8220;festal apparel&#8221; in NKJV), mantles (cloaks), wimples (wide cloths), crisping pins (&#8220;purses&#8221; in NKJV), glasses (mirrors), fine linen, hoods (headdresses), veils, and stomachers (figured mantles for holidays). The various garments and the purses were costly and usually were embroidered elaborately. The mirrors and perfume boxes were often hung from the neck or girdle and worn as ornaments. All of these things have the potential for vanity, and in this case the primary reason for wearing them was pride.</p>
<p class="bodytext">From the foregoing passages in the Old and New Testaments, we learn that our appearance and dress should display humility, modesty, and moderation. We should not wear ornamental jewelry or costly, extravagant clothing. In making decisions about what is appropriate, we should ask, Is this item flashy or gaudy? What is my motive for wearing it? Does it serve a useful purpose? Even if it serves a useful purpose, is it extravagant? Should I consider a less extravagant or less showy alternative? Is God asking me to make a consecration in this area so that I can draw closer to Him?</p>
<p class="bodytext">For example, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets are exclusively ornamental, while a watch is primarily functional rather than ornamental. Even a watch could become ostentatious and vain, however.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If possible, Christians should dress well and in good taste. It is often advisable to spend a greater amount of money for clothing of higher quality, yet we can do so without dressing ostentatiously. Most often, those who are simply and tastefully dressed are the most elegant.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Leaders should carefully consider these teachings and develop personal convictions based on Scripture. They should recognize that their choices in this area will influence others. Indeed, the rest of the congregation will tend to take more liberties than the leaders. Thus, if leaders wear a small item of jewelry that they think is acceptable, followers will tend to <a id="page_141"></a>wear larger items that are questionable or unacceptable. It is advisable, therefore, for leaders to be somewhat stricter on themselves than what they might expect the congregation to be. When in doubt, all Christians, and especially leaders, should choose alternatives that lead to greater consecration and holiness rather than to the possibility of greater worldliness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Guidelines for Children</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The Bible says, &#8220;Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it&#8221; (Proverbs 22:6). We should teach holiness to our children. In choosing and allowing their dress, we should implement the principles of modesty, not using personal ornaments, moderation in cost, distinction between male and female, and separation from the world. Before puberty, modesty is not as significant an issue. Some types of clothing that would be immodest on adults are not immodest on children. Nevertheless, we should not dress children in seductive or provocative styles, as this would be inappropriate and would establish a detrimental precedent for when they grow older.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>A Witness in Early Church History</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">It is interesting to note that despite differences of doctrine and the influx of false doctrines, Christians of the second and third centuries generally continued to adhere to scriptural teachings on adornment and dress. For example, in the third century<span class="smallcaps"> Ad,</span> Tertullian wrote a treatise entitled<i> On Female Dress.</i> In it, he taught against rouge, hair dye, wigs, elaborate hair styling for men and women, eyeliner, jewels, and ornaments. He called Christians to temperance and sacrifice. He said that if God treats lust like fornication, then He will not <a id="page_142"></a>fail to punish those who deliberately arouse lust in others by their dress. He also noted that the person who is accustomed to luxury, jewels, and ornaments will not be willing to sacrifice all, including life itself, for the cause of Christ.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Throughout church history, many revivalists and reformers advocated similar teachings concerning adornment and dress, including the Anabaptists, John Calvin (Reformed leader), John Wesley (Methodist leader), the Holiness movement, and the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Challenge Today</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The final decision rests with us. Will we retain biblical teachings on modesty, humility, and moderation in outward appearance? Will we maintain distinction of the sexes and separation from the world? Or will we succumb to the pressures of the world and its so-called modernization, which is really a revival of ancient evils? Will we identify with God or with the world? May God help us to uphold the complete message of holiness. May God help us to keep the landmarks established by the Word of God, the teaching of our spiritual forefathers, and the leading of the Spirit.</p>
