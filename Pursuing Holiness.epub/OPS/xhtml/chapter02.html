<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_31"></a><i>&#8220;A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Galatians 2:16).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1">Whenever pastors begin to teach practical holiness, they are somtimes accused of legalism. And, indeed, some of those who emphasize holiness do drift into legalism, doing more harm than good. In this chapter we address several key questions: What is legalism? What is wrong with legalism? What are the biblical alternatives to legalism? Is it possible to teach practical holiness and still avoid legalism? If so, how?</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Legalism Defined</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">To ensure we do not drift into the dangerous waters of legalism we must understand what it is. In general, legalism means strict or excessive conformity to a legal code or set of rules. In a Christian context, legalism has two negative connotations: (1) attempting to base salvation on the performance of good works or on the strict observance of rules and regulations and (2) imposing rules on self and others that are not based on clear biblical teachings or principles. We are guilty of legalism if we imply that a person attains salvation by works or if we preach rules without principles.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_32"></a>Legalism Condemned</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Legalism is detrimental and contradicts Christian principles. Jesus opposed the Jewish legalism of His day, particularly that of the Pharisees. These Jewish legalists believed that salvation rested in strict conformity to the law of Moses and the oral traditions they had built around it. Jesus rebuked this self-righteous attitude, the hypocrisy that accompanied it, and the human traditions that actually subverted the Word of God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul pointed out that conformity to external law never meant anything unless the heart was right (Romans 2:17-29). Furthermore, the law of Moses could not and was never intended to impart salvation based on works (Romans 3:19-20; 8:3; Galatians 3:21-22). Rather, it served to teach us several important truths: the definition of sin, our own sinfulness, our lack of power to overcome sin, and our need of salvation (Romans 3:20; 5:20; 7:7-14). The law was a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ so that we would have faith in Him (Galatians 3:21-25). Throughout history, salvation has always been by faith, not by works. Abraham (before the law) and David (under the law) were saved by faith in God, not by good works or conformity to law (Romans 4).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The New Testament church contended for this doctrine of justification by faith against some Jewish Christians who still maintained legalistic concepts. These Judaizers taught that Gentile converts had to be circumcised and had to obey the Jewish law. The church convened its first general council to discuss this issue (Acts 15). At the conference, Peter said Gentile Christians should not have to obey the Jewish law, for God had already given them the Holy Ghost based on their faith alone. James pronounced the decision agreed upon by the church: Gentiles did not have to obey the law of Moses, except to abstain from food offered to idols, blood, things strangled, and fornication.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_33"></a>Paul strongly opposed legalism in general and the Judaizers in particular. He taught that we are justified by faith, not by observance of the law of Moses (Romans 3:20-28). We are saved by grace through faith, not by good works (Ephesians 2:8-9). The gospel of Christ has liberated us from the need to observe the ordinances of the Jewish law (Romans 7:6; Galatians 2:16-21). In fact, if we persist in seeking righteousness by works of the law, we frustrate the grace of God and make Christ&#8217;s death vain (Galatians 2:21).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Specifically, Christ&#8217;s death abolished the Jewish ceremonial law with its unclean foods and drinks, special festival days, and sabbaths. We do not have to follow ritualistic rules that forbid us even to touch certain unclean foods or other items. This kind of legalism may superficially seem to be wise and holy, but it has no power to restrain the lusts of the sinful nature. &#8220;Therefore let no one judge you in food, or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ. . . . Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations &#8216;Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,&#8217; which all concern things which perish with the using&#8212;according to the commandments and doctrines of men? These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility, and neglect of the body, but are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh&#8221; (Colossians 2:16-17, 20-23, NKJV).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In short, legalism is an insufficient motivation to live for God. It will not bring salvation, nor will it produce true holiness. Let us investigate in detail the many inadequacies and dangers of legalism.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_34"></a>Self-Righteous Reliance on Works for Salvation</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Legalism actually teaches salvation by human works instead of God&#8217;s grace. Legalists will attempt to rely on their own human efforts instead of the power of the Holy Ghost. This can lead to pride, self-righteousness, and self-deception if legalists think they are actually saving themselves. On the other hand, it can lead to frustration, lack of assurance of salvation, fear, despair, and backsliding if legalists realize their inability to manufacture their own righteousness and to live by strict adherence to rules.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Bible does stress the importance of good works as the inevitable result of saving grace and saving faith (Ephesians 2:10; Titus 2:11-12; 3:8; James 2:14-26). We must understand, however, that faith produces works, not vice versa. We do not get good to get God; we get God to get good. We do not work toward salvation; we work from salvation. We do not live holy in order to earn salvation; we live holy because we have salvation. We manifest continuing faith in God by a life of submission to Him and obedience to His Word.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A failure to manifest holiness, good works, and obedience indicates either a lack of genuine faith from the beginning or a loss of genuine faith. It indicates either failure to receive salvation initially or subsequent rejection of God&#8217;s continuing work of salvation. If people continue in this condition, they will not be saved when Christ comes for them, but in no way does this imply that they can or must earn salvation by works. The root problem is not failure to produce works, but failure to maintain total faith in God and His Word.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness comes by grace through faith as we submit to the sanctifying work of the Spirit in our lives. If we fail to submit, we reject God&#8217;s grace and salvation. However, legalism actually sidesteps grace, faith, and the Spirit. It tries to produce holiness by human efforts alone and to purchase salvation by that human &#8220;holiness.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_35"></a>Failure to Develop Inward Holiness</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">As the preceding discussion indicates, legalism cannot produce inward holiness. No amount of legislating, keeping, or enforcing law will impart true holiness, for that can only come by the Holy Spirit. Legalism places utmost importance upon an outward show of holiness, while neglecting and ignoring the development of inward holiness (which, of course, will cause holiness to be exhibited outwardly). In the sight of humans, legalists may seem holy, but in the sight of God they are lacking. Even though legalists may be very strict in holiness teaching, they actually fail to develop holiness in their own lives and in the lives of those who follow them.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Failure to Develop a Mature Understanding of Principles</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">We understand the dangers of legalism, but how does a person become legalistic? In particular, legalists do not develop a mature conscience that can guide them to principled decisions in areas where their rules are silent. They walk the thin line between the world and the church. Sooner or later they will step into a gray area and perhaps go from there into sin. They often ignore new dangers that fall outside the scope of their rules. For example, perhaps they have grown up with a rule, &#8220;Thou shalt not attend movies,&#8221; but they do not really understand the spiritual evils of the movies. When new technology introduces home movie systems, they may sense nothing wrong with showing the same movies at home. They may see nothing wrong with watching ungodly TV shows in public places, in a motel room, or on the Internet. Non-legalists will be quick to spot the danger because it violates their principles. They will abstain, not merely because someone forbade <a id="page_36"></a>it, but because it is detrimental to and incompatible with their spiritual life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Legalistic leaders constantly find themselves trying to invent and enforce new rules to cover new situations, because their followers do not know how to apply principles. This effort will always fail because it is impossible to invent enough rules to cover every possible circumstance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Here are some extreme examples to illustrate how a legalist can actually miss the true teaching of God&#8217;s Word even while supposedly following it literally. Jesus taught that if someone strikes me on the right cheek I should turn the other cheek. The legalist may say, &#8220;Ah, but Christ did not restrict my actions after that. After turning the other cheek, then I can get revenge.&#8221; The legalist technically follows the letter of Christ&#8217;s teaching as if it were a rule book, but misses the whole spirit of the passage, which teaches us not to react violently to insult and not to seek vengeance. In one place, Christ said we should forgive a brother seven times in one day, and in another place said we should forgive someone seventy times seven. The legalist may say, &#8220;I will forgive seven times in one day but not eight, or I will forgive 490 times but not 491.&#8221; He or she misses the true teaching of complete, perfect, unlimited forgiveness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Living by Minimum Requirements and Loopholes</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Ironically, then, legalism frequently causes people to observe only the minimum of what they feel is absolutely required. Often they do this out of a desire to impress others. Their attitude is, &#8220;What are the minimum requirements of this church, of this pastor, and of salvation itself?&#8221; They have little desire to seek positive holiness, but define holiness in terms of the negative. They have little principles or conscience to guide them, and feel little restraint on indulging in non-Christian <a id="page_37"></a>behavior if they can get away with it. They look for loopholes in their rules so they can justify whatever they want to do. They may justify participation in a questionable practice because no one has ever preached specifically against it or established a rule that definitely covered it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In short, legalists treat Christianity as if it were a collection of rules like the US Tax Code. They feel no obligation other than what the rules specifically require. As long as they live by the letter of the law, they are free to exploit every doubtful situation or &#8220;loophole&#8221; without regard to God&#8217;s will.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Hypocrisy and Inconsistency</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Legalism results in negative side effects. First of all, it leads to hypocrisy. Since no set of rules can ever cover all situations, legalists usually end up doing as they please. If they cannot satisfy the desires of the flesh in one way, they usually manage to do so in another way. For example, some would never wear a necklace or an earring because of rules against them, but they will satisfy their desire for ornamentation by wearing extremely flashy rings and watches. Some will shun all jewelry but flaunt extravagant, outrageously expensive clothing. Others do not wear lipstick, but think nothing of wearing mascara or blush. They base their conduct only on specific rules of limited application. They are not truly concerned with upholding under all circumstances the biblical teachings against ornamentation, vanity, immodesty, and costly array.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Likewise, legalists may strongly condemn drinking but be oblivious to their own gluttony. They may avoid dirty movies but delight in dirty jokes. They may abhor idolatry but be a slave to materialism. Pursuing holiness with sincerity keeps us from these inconsistencies.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_38"></a>Human Rules</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Legalism takes human rules and treats them as if they were the Word of God. It imposes rules that cannot be justified from the Bible. It goes much farther than the biblical text will warrant.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Christian must limit himself to the Bible in establishing guidelines for conduct. All teachings must be taken either from a specific biblical injunction or from a valid application of biblical principles. For example, the Bible specifically describes drunkenness as sin, so we can and we must preach against drunkenness. In addition, the underlying biblical principle is that all intoxication is wrong; therefore we can preach against marijuana even though the Bible does not mention that drug by name. However, legalism goes beyond either biblical statements or principles, and establishes rules that originate in the mind of humans.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Misapplication of Principles</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Legalists often take guidelines that once made some sense under certain circumstances and blindly misapply them to different circumstances. Without understanding the scriptural principle behind a certain guideline, they transplant it to a situation where it is unnecessary and inappropriate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This causes confusion when someone tries to understand the system rationally or scripturally. For example, sometimes holiness people do not attend certain places of amusement in their community because of the worldly atmosphere, the type of people that attend them, and the type of ungodly activities associated with them. The legalist enshrines this as a rule: &#8220;Thou shalt not participate in this amusement.&#8221; The non-legalist recognizes this as a practical application of important scriptural principles: &#8220;Abstain from the appearance <a id="page_39"></a>of evil, love not the world nor the things of the world, avoid worldly pleasures, and avoid fellowship with unrighteousness.&#8221; However, we should not look legalistically at the particular amusement in itself but whether participation is worldly or not in a given situation. We should understand the reason for the guideline. The amusement itself could be harmless or wholesome in a different setting.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Difficulty in Maintaining the System</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">It is extremely difficult to maintain a legalistic system. First, it is simply impossible for someone to abide by all the rules. Legalists will always fail. Either they will become hypocrites, condemning others but excusing themselves, or they will live under continual guilt and fear.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Furthermore, those who follow a legalistic leader will eventually begin to doubt the validity of the system because of its harsh and arbitrary rules. As children grow up in the system they begin to question the rules. When new converts enter the system they often accept everything uncritically, but sooner or later they, too, begin to analyze the rules.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If a church is founded on true scriptural principles, it will withstand scrutiny of its teachings. Legalists, however, usually give no justification for their human rules except tradition and authority. &#8220;This is what our church believes, and you must obey the church. This is what the pastor teaches, and you must obey the pastor.&#8221; This kind of teaching will not be successful in developing true holiness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Particularly in our questioning age, it simply does not work. People today are more sophisticated and educated than ever before. There is a greater willingness to challenge tradition and authority. Autocratic methods that people sometimes accepted in the past are less and less effective today.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_40"></a>Judgmental and Condemnatory Attitude</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Finally, legalism fosters a judgmental, condemnatory attitude towards others. Legalists tend to pigeonhole everyone and then make their disapproval obvious to those found wanting. Legalistic church members often develop a harsh, intolerant, defensive attitude towards those who do not conform exactly to their rules, even towards visitors and new converts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Even if someone is living in violation of God&#8217;s Word, the Bible forbids the individual Christian to judge or condemn. Jesus said, &#8220;Judge not, that ye be not judged&#8221; (Matthew 7:1). We must simply present the Word of God without setting ourselves up as judges over someone else. Christ did not come to condemn the people of the world, for they are already condemned by their sin, but He came to offer salvation (John 3:17; 8:11). Likewise, the church&#8217;s business is to offer salvation to all. We must let the Word and the Spirit bring conviction, and let God be the final judge.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once, a long-haired man visited a certain church. He received so many stares and disapproving expressions that he felt very uncomfortable. Because of that experience, he vowed never to return again. This is a sad example of legalistic condemnation. The church does not have to<i> approve </i>of everything about a visitor, but it should<i> accept</i> the visitor for what he is and love him unconditionally. After all, that is how Christ treated sinners while on earth and how He treats everyone today.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In one church a new convert heard a minister proclaim, &#8220;It is a sin for a man to have hair on his ears.&#8221; The new convert, whose hair covered his ears, decided that this church was a cult and resolved never to return again. Of course, the Bible does teach men to have short hair. A reasonable application of that principle in our day would result in cutting the hair above the ear and collar. Furthermore, the new convert should not have allowed anything to offend him. However, it seems to <a id="page_41"></a>be legalistic overkill to state that a man will go to Hell if his hair touches his ear. We simply cannot find Scripture to support this statement. In any event, it serves no useful purpose to present this view in a harsh way to someone who does not have the spiritual maturity to evaluate it properly. It is the responsibility of the mature saint not to place a stumbling block in the path of others.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Improper Alternatives to Legalism</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">As mature Christians in a loving relationship with Jesus Christ, we want to avoid legalism, but what is the proper way to do so? Many people who see the dangers of legalism reject it, but in the process they sometimes discard practical holiness altogether. Frequently what happens is this: one generation discovers a life-changing relationship with God and embraces scriptural holiness. They rearrange their entire lifestyle around the concepts of separation from the world and dedication to God, and they pass this new-found lifestyle to the next generation. Somewhere in the process of transmission to future generations, legalistic tendencies creep in. What began as joyous submission to the will of God becomes a codified set of rules and regulations, which are justified on the basis of tradition and ritual.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Finally, one generation rebels against this cold, dry system and begins to question its values. Sometimes they fail to realize that many good and precious truths have been handed to them, albeit in the wrong way; they have been taught many right things for the wrong reasons. When they rightfully reject legalism, they also discard true holiness principles and valid practical applications. They throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In such a case, the preceding generation is to blame for making the truth vulnerable by their nonbiblical approach in <a id="page_42"></a>teaching it. On the other hand, the new generation is to blame for not studying these issues prayerfully and for not developing a genuine love for truth at all costs. They see legalistic tendencies they rightfully reject, but they use the occasion as an excuse to disregard any holiness standards and to indulge in the desires of the flesh. The root problem on both sides is a failure to commit quality time in serious, prayerful study of the Word of God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some suppose that we must abandon holiness teaching in order to have revival. However, we should never sacrifice quality in favor of quantity. In fact, the more we emphasize and implement the Word of God the more we will have true, apostolic revival. A church does not have to be legalistic to emphasize holiness. Nor does a church have to go to the opposite extreme of worldliness in order to grow. A conservative, holiness church can have revival. Indeed, most of our great revival churches strongly advocate holiness of life on a practical level.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In short, many suppose that the proper alternative to legalism is antinomianism (no law), license (freedom without responsibility), or libertinism (no moral restraints). They insist they can have inward holiness without any guidelines as to outward appearance and conduct. However, this attitude totally contradicts God&#8217;s Word. True holiness is not freedom to act and look like the world, but freedom from conformity to the world. Intellectual freedom is not freedom from truth, but freedom to know and submit to truth. There can be no real freedom outside truth. &#8220;Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free&#8221; (John 8:32). Genuine spiritual freedom is not freedom to commit sin, but freedom from the bondage to sin.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_43"></a>The Importance of Moral Law</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">We must reject legalism as inadequate to bring about true holiness, but we must not reject God&#8217;s moral law or the necessity of obedience to God&#8217;s Word. God has always had law; He has always had specific commands that people must obey. Even in the age of innocence in the Garden of Eden He gave Adam and Eve a specific prohibition. God&#8217;s moral nature never changes, and therefore neither does His moral law.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He has progressively revealed more of His moral law from Old Testament to New Testament times, but He has never abolished moral law. Jesus Himself told us that law or commandments would continue to exist in the New Testament church. &#8220;If ye love me, keep my commandments. . . . If a man love me, he will keep my words&#8221; (John 14:15, 23). He commissioned His disciples to teach all converts &#8220;to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you&#8221; (Matthew 28:20).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus did not come to destroy the law but to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17). When He opposed the Jewish legalism of His day, He indicated that true holiness would be even more demanding spiritually. &#8220;Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven&#8221; (Matthew 5:20). He recognized that in most cases the Pharisees taught correct doctrine. He did not reject their teachings as much as he rejected their attitude and their inconsistent conduct. He told the people, &#8220;The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses&#8217; seat: All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not&#8221; (Matthew 23:2-3).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Pharisees were such sticklers for the law that they paid tithes even on small herbs, which grew in gardens. Jesus rebuked them for their attention to detail while disregarding more important things spiritually. Some today would say such attention to petty detail does not matter, but it only <a id="page_44"></a>matters that motives and intentions be pure. However, Jesus did not rebuke the scrupulous tithe paying, but in fact commended it. He endorsed obedience to God&#8217;s Word in both the seemingly insignificant details and in the larger principles (Matthew 23:23).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The doctrine of justification by faith does not destroy the principle of law but rather establishes it (Romans 3:31), for we do not need justification if there is no law to condemn us. God&#8217;s laws are written in the believer&#8217;s heart (Hebrews 10:16). The Spirit enables us to fulfill the righteousness that the law taught but could not produce (Romans 8:4).</p>
<p class="bodytext">As we have seen, Paul rejected ritualistic laws that forbade Christians to touch, taste, or handle foods regarded as ceremonially unclean (Colossians 2:14-23). Some today use this teaching to reject all moral guidelines and all restraints on worldly conduct. However, Paul also wrote, &#8220;Touch not the unclean thing&#8221; (II Corinthians 6:17). Paul did not contradict himself.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Christians today should still abstain from immoral, ungodly, worldly things. The ceremonial law has been abolished, but there are still many activities in this world that Christians must avoid as morally or spiritually unclean. Paul even compared the Christian life to a game with certain rules that must be obeyed to obtain victory: &#8220;And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules&#8221; (II Timothy 2:5, NKJV).</p>
<p class="bodytext">God still has many specific, practical guidelines as to what His people should and should not do. If we followed the definition of legalism that some use, Christ&#8217;s Sermon on the Mount and many portions of Paul&#8217;s epistles would be legalistic.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some think our practical application of moral law is too restrictive. Moral law is indeed a restricting force, but that does not make it bad. The sinful nature needs a restraint upon its desires. The spiritual man needs protection against the evils of the world. Railroad tracks keep the train on course; without them the train would go nowhere. Gravity binds us <a id="page_45"></a>to the earth; without it we would drift off into our own little world and die. Gravity keeps the earth allied with the sun; without it the earth would fly off on its own separate path without the life-sustaining light, heat, and energy that the sun provides.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The banks of a river define it and channel it. If the banks were moved farther apart without increasing the volume of water, the river would lose force and velocity. If the banks were eliminated, the river would dissipate its strength without arriving at its destination. It would lose its identity as a river. Likewise, holiness teachings do not force hardship on us, but bind us closely to a holy God who is our source of life and strength. They preserve our identity, channel our spiritual energy, provide direction, and enhance our spiritual strength, so that we can arrive at our final destination safely.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The fence around a garden does not serve to curb the freedom of the garden but to preserve its freedom. The fence protects the garden from external encroachment that would bring damage or destruction. In like manner, holiness teachings do not curb our freedom in Christ but protect us from evils that would destroy our freedom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In rejecting legalism, then, we must be careful not to reject moral law or practical applications of moral law. We must still uphold specific biblical teachings as well as valid application of biblical principles to situations in modern society. We must not allow either the legalistic teachings of some or the &#8220;anti-law&#8221; teachings of others to deflect us from the path of holiness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Our salvation and our holiness rest in Christ and the working of His Spirit, not in our own goodness. His Spirit produces <a id="page_46"></a>holiness, both internally and externally, as we discipline ourselves, submit to Him, and obey Him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We have principles to guide our conduct under all circumstances. We should not seek minimum requirements, but the application of principles to every situation, new or old. We must not be hypocritical, but should strive to live consistently by biblical principles, which are not made irrelevant by changes of culture, time, or geography.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Correct principles carry their own authority with them since they stem from the Word of God. We must not be judgmental of others because we recognize that our holiness comes from God and not from any goodness inherent within ourselves. We should not be condemnatory of others because our lives must be dominated by love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Faith and love make us more concerned with leading sinners to salvation than changing their conduct. When they are born again, they will receive the desire and power to change, making it unnecessary to use harsh, dictatorial methods to teach them. Our reliance will be upon the power of the Word, the Spirit, and personal example. Instead of instantly imposing rules on new converts, we should exercise love, patience, and tolerance to let them mature at an individual rate of growth. We must preach that holiness results from salvation and that biblical principles form the base of all practical guidelines. Practical holiness is indeed scriptural, and a sincere convert will see this as he or she matures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In conclusion, we can reject legalism and still emphasize practical holiness. This will be done when we place total faith in Jesus Christ, let our lives be dominated by love for Him, sincerely seek to obey the teachings of the Word of God, live in submission to the indwelling Holy Spirit, and make the personal effort required to implement holiness principles in our lives.</p>
