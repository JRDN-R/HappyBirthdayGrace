<h2 class="h2b"><b><a id="page_173"></a><a id="ch22"/><a href="contents.html#ch22">Sexual Relationships</a></b></h2>
<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;Thou shalt not commit adultery&#8221; (Exodus 20:14).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;Abstain from . . . fornication&#8221; (Acts 15:20).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1">We conclude our study of holiness with attention to how we treat our bodies and how we interact with one another. The Bible is clear in its teaching regarding marriage and sexual relationships. It endorses the marriage of one man and one woman who make a lifelong commitment, and it condemns all sexual relationships outside such a marriage. Numerous passages in both testaments condemn adultery and fornication. Together, these words refer to all extramarital sexual relationships.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Marriage</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">God instituted marriage in the very beginning by creating Adam and then creating Eve as &#8220;a helper comparable to him&#8221; (Genesis 2:18, 24, NKJV), or &#8220;a helper as his partner&#8221; (NRSV). God&#8217;s purpose in ordaining marriage was to provide for companionship, communion, and partnership between husband and wife and to devise a method of procreation. His plan was for husband and wife to leave their families and form a union with each other (Genesis 2:24). This union was to be <a id="page_174"></a>heterosexual, lifelong, and monogamous, for God had joined them together.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Although some prominent men in the Old Testament practiced polygamy, this was not God&#8217;s plan from the beginning. Polygamy was introduced by Lamech, who was also the second recorded murderer (Genesis 4:19, 23). The Bible specifically insists on monogamy for kings, bishops, deacons, and elders (Deuteronomy 17:17; I Timothy 3:2, 12; Titus 1:6). We can conclude, then, that God&#8217;s plan for marriage was monogamy and a lasting commitment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As such, God hates divorce (Malachi 2:15-16). In Matthew 19:3-9, some Pharisees tested Jesus by asking Him about divorce. He explained that the law of Moses allowed divorce only because of the hardness of people&#8217;s hearts. Then He reiterated God&#8217;s original plan for marriage: &#8220;They twain shall be one flesh. . . . What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">God created sex as a sacred part of the marriage relationship. He is the one who created male and female and placed an attraction between them. Some traditions teach that sex is somehow degrading, carnal, or base. They regard it as an evil necessary for the propagation of the human race, but it is not supposed to be pleasurable, and holy people are not supposed to indulge in it. This view is simply false. Sexual desire within marriage is proper. The purpose of the sexual relationship is for the consummation and strengthening of the union of a man and a woman, as well as for procreation. (See Proverbs 5:15-23; I Corinthians 7:1-5.) Those who forbid marriage are teaching false doctrine (I Timothy 4:1-3). Hebrews 13:4 summarizes the truth about the sexual relationship: &#8220;Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Because most people in our society, including youth, have been exposed to explicit discussions of sexuality, we must be plain in presenting a biblical viewpoint. Within marriage, the <a id="page_175"></a>ultimate form of sexual satisfaction as planned by God is sexual intercourse. Various aspects of foreplay and mutual stimulation are also acceptable if both marriage partners agree and find mutual enjoyment. (See Song of Solomon 7:1-13; 8:3.) A couple should not do anything that either considers to be unnatural, unclean, or degrading. (As a possible example, see Leviticus 20:18; Ezekiel 18:6; 22:10.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sex and marriage are sacred because they involve the lifelong union of two people and because they involve procreation. By the union of male and female, a child is born. This child is a joint creation with God, a soul that will live forever. God intends for a child to be born only within the protected environment of marriage.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Biblical Definitions of Sexual Sins</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Under the law of Moses, various sexual transgressions were punished by death, demonstrating the seriousness with which God views such sins. Although every sin is dangerous and will result in eternal judgment, there is still something particularly serious about sexual sins. The reason is that they violate the sacredness of marriage. Those who commit fornication are joined together as one flesh&#8212;a physical, emotional, and spiritual union God intends to occur only in the context of a lifelong marriage relationship (I Corinthians 6:15-16). Other sins are committed outside the body, but fornication is a sin against one&#8217;s own body (verse 18).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Unlike some other sins, once a sexual sin is committed there is no way to make full restitution or put the sinners back into their original status. Thieves may be able to return what they have stolen. Liars may be able to correct their lies. A sexual sin cannot be undone, and it can affect a person for life. Ministers can become disqualified from their position, because they must be blameless, the husband of one wife, and of good report <a id="page_176"></a>(I Timothy 3:2, 7; Titus 1:6). (See also Luke 9:62.) God will readily forgive those who repent of sexual sins, but these sins often cause serious and even irreversible consequences in this life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The first general conference of the New Testament church accepted the Old Testament definition and prohibition of sexual sin. It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to the church to identify the teaching against all forms of sexual immorality as one of the four necessary parts of the Jewish law that all Christians, including Gentiles, must continue to obey (Acts 15:19-29; 21:25).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The following Scriptures give us a basis for analyzing specific sexual sins: &#8220;Put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience&#8221; (Colossians 3:5-6, NKJV). &#8220;For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual immorality; that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel [body&#8212;NIV] in sanctification and honor, not in passion of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God; that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also forewarned you and testified. For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in holiness. Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit&#8221; (I Thessalonians 4:3-8, NKJV).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Let us identify various sexual sins that the Bible condemns.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Fornication,</i></b> from the Greek<i> porneia,</i> means unlawful sexual intercourse or &#8220;sexual immorality&#8221; (NKJV). Due to the open sinfulness of our day, we must explain plainly that fornication means all sexual intercourse outside a biblical marriage, including oral and anal sex. The Bible recommends marriage as a way to avoid the temptation of fornication (I Corinthians 7:2). Many times the New Testament teaches <a id="page_177"></a>against fornication. (See I Corinthians 6:13-18; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; I Thessalonians 4:3.) In English, when the word<i> fornication</i> is used in a restricted sense, it refers to sex involving unmarried people. The law gave the death penalty for this sin (Deuteronomy 22:20-21).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Adultery</i></b> is prohibited by many passages of Scripture. (See Exodus 20:14; Leviticus 18:20; Deuteronomy 5:18.) Death was the penalty under the law for both parties in a case of adultery with a married woman (Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22). The word refers to sex where at least one party is married, but not to the other. Adultery appears in the lists of the sins of the flesh (Matthew 15:19-20; I Corinthians 6:9-11; Galatians 5:19-21).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Incest</i></b> is sex between closely related people, such as between parent and child or between siblings. There were twenty laws defining this sin (Leviticus 18:6-18; Deuteronomy 22:30). A man who committed adultery with his father&#8217;s wife was punished by death (Leviticus 20:11). This sin was present in the Corinthian church and needed to be judged (I Corinthians 5).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Child molestation</i></b> clearly violates the foregoing teachings against fornication and adultery, and it often involves incest. Abuse of children will result in harsh judgment from God. (See Matthew 18:1-4; Luke 17:2.)</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Bestiality,</i></b> sex with animals, was punished by death for both the person and the animal involved (Exodus 22:19; Leviticus 18:23; 20:15-16; Deuteronomy 27:21).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Rape</i></b> was punished by death (Deuteronomy 22:23-27).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Lust.</i></b> Jesus taught, &#8220;Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart&#8221; (Matthew 5:28). Temptation that comes to the mind or eye is not sin in itself, but it becomes sin if we entertain it and allow it to develop into lust (James 1:14-15; Matthew 4:1-11). Based on the words of Jesus, if we look at someone who is not <a id="page_178"></a>our spouse and begin fantasizing about or desiring sex with that person, we have committed sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Lewdness and uncleanness.</i></b> In the biblical teaching against unlawful sexual lust and acts, the KJV uses several additional words:<i> concupiscence</i> (strong desire, especially sexual desire),<i> lasciviousness</i> (&#8220;lewdness&#8221; in NKJV), and<i> uncleanness</i> (impurity). (See Mark 7:22; II Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Colossians 3:5; I Thessalonians 4:3-7.) The latter two words include lustful thoughts, speech, and actions.<i> Lewdness</i> refers to anything that promotes or gratifies sexual lust, whether or not a sexual act is committed.<i> Uncleanness</i> covers all sexual sin, and it includes perversion (Romans 1:24).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Lascivious or lewd activities include mutual sexual stimulation outside marriage, pornography, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and indecent exposure. Worldly places with a lustful atmosphere and worldly activities that arouse lust fall under this category. Books, music, movies, television, dancing, stories, and jokes can all be lewd.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Intimate embracing can be sexually arousing. Such activity between unmarried persons leads to lust and often to fornication. Thus, holding hands, hugging, and kissing are not appropriate for casual dating but should be reserved for serious relationships and should be carefully controlled. Any further intimacy must be reserved for marriage. It is wrong for unmarried couples to engage in intimate caressing or other sexual stimulation. Even between engaged couples, kissing and embracing should be controlled.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Pornography</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Pornography is a serious problem in our day, especially since it is readily available on the Internet, mobile devices, cable television, videos, and DVDs, as well as in print. It is <a id="page_179"></a>strongly addictive. To avoid this sin, it is important to place controls on these media and to maintain spiritual disciplines such as prayer, fasting, and Bible study. In addition, to overcome this sin, it is also important to become accountable to one&#8217;s spouse and possibly to a mentor or prayer partner. The pastor can help to implement an appropriate system of accountability, control, and spiritual discipline.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Masturbation (Self-Stimulation)</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The Bible does not say anything about masturbation, so we will look to general scriptural teachings on sexual matters. We can identify two potential problems: lustful fantasies and addictive behavior. Ultimately, this is a question that each individual will have to answer personally.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus taught that if a man looks at a woman lustfully he has committed adultery with her in his heart (Matthew 5:28). Paul advised Timothy to flee youthful lusts, to keep a good conscience, and to keep a pure heart (I Timothy 1:19; II Timothy 2:22). Lustful, lascivious thoughts are contrary to the Word of God. At the least, fantasizing about sexual relationships with a particular individual other than one&#8217;s spouse is contrary to the teachings of the Bible. Questions to ask are: Does masturbation lead one to entertain improper lusts and fantasies? Does masturbation make one feel guilty or defiled?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another point to consider is the purpose of sex. God designed it to be an important component of the intimate personal relationship between husband and wife. Sex is meant to be a shared expression of joy and love. Thus, it seems that habitual masturbation or psychological dependence on masturbation is not God&#8217;s plan.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_180"></a>Effeminate Behavior</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Effeminate behavior is a sin that will keep men from inheriting the kingdom of God (I Corinthians 6:9-10). The KJV word is from the Greek<i> malakos,</i> which means &#8220;soft, i.e. fine (clothing), figuratively a catamite.&#8221; A catamite is a boy kept for purposes of sexual perversion. In other contexts, this word is translated as &#8220;soft,&#8221; for soft raiment or clothing (Matthew 11:8; Luke 7:25). The same passage also lists &#8220;abusers of themselves with mankind&#8221; (Greek,<i> arsenokoit&#275;s).</i> The NKJV translates these two words as &#8220;homosexuals&#8221; and &#8220;sodomites,&#8221; which are synonymous in English. The<i> Interlinear Greek-English New Testament</i> translates the first as &#8220;voluptuous persons&#8221; and the second as &#8220;sodomites.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">The primary reference is to homosexual activity, but the use of two words instead of merely one is significant. Some scholars suggest that the intent is to encompass both the passive partner and the active partner in homosexual relationships. We conclude that these words prohibit all homosexual behavior as well as men looking, acting, or dressing like women.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this regard, we note that Deuteronomy 22:5 prohibits both males and females from wearing clothing that pertains to the opposite sex, which in its most blatant form is called <i>transvestism.</i> (See chapter 8.) Similarly, men are to have short hair, while women are to have long hair (I Corinthians 11:14-15). (See chapter 9.) Clearly, God intends for there to be a clear distinction between the sexes. Men should not be effeminate and women should not be mannish in mannerisms, behavior, or dress.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_181"></a>Homosexual Behavior</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Homosexual behavior, or sexual relations between people of the same sex, will prevent someone from inheriting the kingdom of God (I Corinthians 6:9-10). When it involves women, this sin is also called<i> lesbianism.</i> The law gave the death penalty for homosexual acts (Leviticus 20:13). These acts are an abomination&#8212;something that will keep people from Heaven (Leviticus 18:22; Revelation 21:27). Both prostitution and sodomy were so abhorrent that the money obtained by such activities could not be brought to the house of God (Deuteronomy 23:17-18). The price charged by a male prostitute was called the &#8220;hire of a dog&#8221; and was forbidden as an offering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Homosexuality is called<i> sodomy</i> from the story of Sodom in Genesis 19:4-11. When two angels in the form of men visited Lot&#8217;s house, the men of Sodom attempted to assault them sexually. They asked Lot to bring his guests out &#8220;that we may know them&#8221;&#8212;a biblical euphemism for sexual intercourse. (See Genesis 4:1.) When Lot refused, they threatened to do worse to him than to his visitors. They refused to take Lot&#8217;s two virgin daughters instead of the angels. Finally, the angels pulled Lot into the house, shut the door, and struck the men with blindness. Even then, the men &#8220;wearied themselves to find the door.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Homosexuality is one of the major sins for which God destroyed the city. Some people claim that the men&#8217;s sin was only their inhospitality rather than their homosexuality. Jude 7 refutes this notion, saying the people of Sodom sinned by giving themselves to sexual immorality and &#8220;going after strange flesh.&#8221; (See also II Peter 2:6-22.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">A similar story occurs in Judges 19:22-25. Certain men of Gibeah in Benjamin, whom the Bible calls &#8220;sons of Belial,&#8221; tried to assault a male guest in the town. They were appeased only when he allowed them to have his concubine, whom they <a id="page_182"></a>raped until she died. The other tribes demanded that these men be executed, but the Benjamites protected them. A civil war resulted that almost completely destroyed the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another Old Testament story shows that it is important to guard against the possibility of homosexual misconduct. Noah got drunk on wine one day and lay naked in his tent in a drunken sleep (Genesis 9:20-27). One of his sons, Ham, observed Noah&#8217;s nakedness and told his brothers. The brothers, Shem and Japheth, went in backwards and covered their father. When Noah awoke, he &#8220;knew what his younger son had done unto him.&#8221; He pronounced a curse on Ham, saying that Ham&#8217;s offspring would be a servant of Shem and Japheth. The wording and the magnitude of the punishment indicate that Ham&#8217;s transgression was serious&#8212;possibly involving homosexual lust or action.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Kings Asa, Jehoshaphat, and Josiah removed sodomites from the land of Judah in accordance with God&#8217;s will and as a part of their reform programs (I Kings 15:12; 22:46; II Kings 23:7). One of Judah&#8217;s great sins was allowing boys to be sold as prostitutes (Joel 3:3). Pagan religions of that day incorporated homosexuality and female prostitution in ritual worship. Some have argued that this was the only reason why the Old Testament condemns homosexuality, but this argument cannot account for the judgment upon Sodom or the strong teachings of the New Testament.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The New Testament church endorsed the Old Testament teaching against homosexuality when it announced that Christians must abstain from fornication, that is, all sexual transgressions as defined by the law of Moses (Acts 15:19-29).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Romans 1 includes homosexual conduct in its account of the step-by-step decline of the human race into sin. It states that all humans have an opportunity to know the existence and power of God. Therefore, they are without excuse if they refuse to acknowledge and worship Him (verse 20). Since <a id="page_183"></a>they did not glorify Him as God, nor were they thankful, they began to worship images of His creation instead of Him (verses 21-23). As a result, God gave them up to uncleanness &#8220;to dishonour their own bodies between themselves&#8221; (verse 24). Since they worshiped the creature more than the Creator, God gave them up to &#8220;vile affections.&#8221; The women changed the natural use of their bodies into something that is against nature, namely, lesbianism (verse 26). Likewise, the men left the natural use of the woman and burned in lust towards each other, &#8220;men with men working that which is unseemly&#8221; (verse 27). They did not like to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a reprobate (debased, depraved) mind (verse 28).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Homosexuality is contrary to nature, because it involves use of the body contrary to God&#8217;s design. It thwarts God&#8217;s purpose for instituting sexuality, namely, to operate in the context of marriage between a man and a woman. In that setting, sex is a strong bond that unites male and female in a complementary relationship, and it provides the means for procreation. Homosexuality does not advance either purpose.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some apologists claim that homosexuality is natural because researchers have occasionally observed this behavior among animals. At most, this evidence would show that such behavior is bestial or animalistic, not a model for humans. We do not think that other common animal behaviors such as forced sexual intercourse, violent aggression, unprovoked killing, and cannibalism are appropriate for humans.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Romans 1 reveals that homosexuality is the final depravity that results when humans persistently refuse to worship God. It is the final outcome of worshiping the creation&#8212;that is, the body&#8212;instead of God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This passage does not say that an individual who practices homosexuality is necessarily a greater sinner than others, however. Rather, it indicates that as human society moves further and further away from godly principles, there will <a id="page_184"></a>be a greater incidence of homosexuality. It becomes more prevalent as society gets further from God, as homes and marriages break up, as men abdicate their responsibilities, as women usurp the male role, and as evil spirits are able to operate more freely. Homosexuality is not necessarily a sign of extraordinary individual sin, but it is a product and a sign of the evil age in which we live.</p>
<p class="bodytext">No one who practices homosexuality can inherit the kingdom of God (I Corinthians 6:9-10). As previously discussed, this passage uses two Greek words to define homosexuality&#8212;<i>malakos</i> and<i> arsenokoit&#275;s</i>&#8212;which the NKJV translates as &#8220;homosexuals&#8221; and &#8220;sodomites.&#8221; The word<i> arsenokoit&#275;s </i>comes from the word<i> ars&#275;n,</i> meaning &#8220;male, man,&#8221; and<i> koit&#275;, </i>literally meaning &#8220;bed&#8221; and by extension &#8220;sexual intercourse.&#8221; This language is as clear and unambiguous as possible.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We find another condemnation of homosexuality in</p>
<p class="bodytext">I Timothy 1:10 using the same Greek word, which is translated as &#8220;them that defile themselves with mankind&#8221; (KJV) or &#8220;sodomites&#8221; (NKJV).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the Tribulation, Jerusalem will be called the city of Sodom and Egypt (Revelation 11:8). In other words, it will be the headquarters of sexual perversion and spiritual adultery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The word<i> uncleanness</i> includes all types of immorality, perversion, and homosexuality as in Romans 1:24. The New Testament repeatedly condemns uncleanness. (See</p>
<p class="bodytext">II Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 4:19; 5:3; Colossians 3:5; I Thessalonians 4:7; II Peter 2:10.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Our study reveals that homosexual behavior is sinful. It is not an illness or an alternative lifestyle, although typically it becomes an addiction or a spiritual bondage. To those who repent and seek deliverance, God will give power to resist temptation and live a new life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Likewise,<i> transgender</i> or<i> transsexual</i> behavior is sinful. These terms refer to people who live contrary to their biological sex or undergo a sex-change operation. When such people <a id="page_185"></a>repent, they should seek ways to fulfill God&#8217;s original plan for their lives once again. If this proves to be impossible, they can live in celibacy. (Perhaps the principle of I Corinthians 7:20-24 would apply here. See NKJV.)</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Factors That Influence Homosexual Behavior</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Certain factors can increase a person&#8217;s susceptibility to homosexual temptations. Some characteristics of culture, personality, physique, background, or life experience can make a person vulnerable, just as some people are prone to alcoholism, promiscuity, or criminal conduct. But by God&#8217;s grace, these factors can be overcome.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Science has not demonstrated that homosexuality is genetic in origin. It is not correct to say, &#8220;I was born a homosexual,&#8221; or &#8220;God made me a homosexual.&#8221; Homosexuality cannot be strictly hereditary, for throughout history those who were exclusively homosexual could not procreate and therefore could not pass on their genes to future generations. A few homosexual researchers have claimed to find features of brain structure or chemistry that they link to homosexuality, but if these characteristics indeed exist, they are most likely a result of homosexual activity rather than a cause. In the final analysis, if there were some biological component to homosexuality, it would simply demonstrate that human nature has been corrupted by sin, just as the Bible teaches.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In reality, conscious human behavior involves a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Humans are not creatures of instinct, but they have the power to choose and regulate their conduct. While we cannot escape the power of sin except by God&#8217;s grace, we can choose to act or refrain from acting in specific ways. If this were not so, there would be no point in outlawing various forms of criminal behavior.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_186"></a>It is true that some people become aware of homosexual thoughts and tendencies at an early age and do not remember a time when they consciously chose homosexuality over heterosexuality. Their thoughts and feelings were molded by factors early in life. It is helpful to identify such factors in order to help prevent and overcome homosexuality, but they do not provide any justification for continuing in this lifestyle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Psychologists have identified a number of factors that help to shape homosexual behavior. Children are more likely to become homosexual if they are not able to identify with their same-sex parent but become excessively attached to the opposite-sex parent. For example, if a father is physically absent from the home, is grossly abusive, is ineffectual and weak, or is feared and hated, there is a greater chance that his son will identify with his mother. The same thing can happen when the mother is extremely affectionate but controlling or domineering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In such situations, the boy may identify with the feminine role and may crave male approval and love. He may resent his mother&#8217;s domination or feel inadequate in comparison to her, and then transfer these feelings to women in general. He may see all women as untouchable saintly figures like his mother. Or he may become so overly loyal to his mother that he cannot have a normal relationship with another woman. Any one of these reactions can lead to homosexuality.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another key influence is early sexual experience. A childhood or youthful encounter with a homosexual can shape behavior later on, especially if the experience is perceived as normal or pleasurable. Children who are molested by same-sex persons may grow to think of such encounters as normal or to define their identity by such encounters. When youth undergo puberty and begin to develop sexual awareness, they can be strongly influenced by homosexual experimentation or seduction.</p>
<p class="bodytext">An early love affair that ends disastrously, including one that results in an illegitimate child or an abortion, may cause feelings of rejection, guilt, and fear that can push the individual <a id="page_187"></a>away from the other sex. Feelings of physical inadequacy, sometimes stemming from physical or emotional problems, can do the same. Moreover, adolescent alienation is a powerful force. The lack of suitable same-sex friends and a lack of participation in typical activities of the same sex can create a need for companionship and acceptance that is later met by homosexuality. Alienation and ridicule from peers may also drive the adolescent into contact and relationships with homosexuals, who can easily influence him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Women who have had abusive relationships with men sometimes retreat into lesbianism. They may feel safer with another woman or may feel that it is easier to understand and be understood by another woman.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the prevailing culture condones and glamorizes homosexual behavior, it encourages experimentation and involvement. People who are struggling with their identity, people who are rebounding from a bad situation, and people who are jaded by their life of promiscuity can become candidates for the homosexual life. As Romans 1 teaches, when society rejects God, it descends into worship of the creation, which leads to worship of the body, which leads to sexual immorality and promiscuity. Sexual immorality leads to the breakdown of marriage and family. As marriages and families become dysfunctional and disintegrate, the factors that promote homosexuality become more prevalent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At the same time, people find that sexual immorality does not provide the satisfaction and fulfillment that they expected. Thus, they place even more emphasis on sexuality, become more promiscuous, and seek new forms of immorality, all in a vain attempt to find satisfaction. This quest leads to an increase of all kinds of deviant sexual behavior, including multiple marriages, fetishism, sadism, masochism, hardcore pornography, child molestation, transvestism, bestiality, and homosexuality. Thus, the widespread practice and acceptance of homosexuality indicates that society has reached the final <a id="page_188"></a>stage of degeneration from God&#8217;s plan, just as Romans 1 explains. We have arrived at this point in twenty-first-century Western culture.</p>
<p class="bodytext">An understanding of these influences and processes can help leaders to prevent, correct, or at least counteract unhealthy situations. This understanding also helps people who are struggling with homosexual desires by showing them some of the contributing factors. Once they realize that they were not born a certain way but have been influenced by unhealthy relationships and negative events, they have hope for change. They can take responsibility for their actions and can begin to remold their lives. They can learn how to modify their thinking, habits, and behavior and, most of all, how to trust God for victory.</p>
<p class="bodytext">An understanding of these matters can also help parents to raise their children properly. For instance, we see how important it is for fathers to develop warm personal relationships with their children; for wives not to usurp their husbands&#8217; authority in the home; for children to have suitable same-sex companionship with their peers; and for parents, especially mothers, not to pamper, overindulge, or overprotect their sons.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We also realize that we cannot trust society or public schools to offer appropriate guidance in sexual matters. Instead, parents and churches must provide the necessary training in biblical truth, including the different roles of the sexes and the proper relationship between the sexes. We must teach our children and youth how to avoid unhealthy situations and how to deal with problems. We must protect them from unwholesome influences and experiences that can influence them in the wrong direction at a crucial stage in their lives.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_189"></a>Overcoming Homosexual Behavior</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">As we have already stated, psychological and environmental factors do not justify the practice of homosexuality. Every habitual sin can be influenced or encouraged by an unhealthy background and negative experiences. Adults still have the ability and responsibility to determine what is right and wrong and to choose what is right. Many people have overcome under similar circumstances, even those who were subjected to the same family and environment factors. Ultimately, through the Holy Spirit we receive power to be victorious in every situation as we learn to yield to God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At the same time, we must recognize that homosexuality is a powerful force. First, it typically results from early life experiences that are hard to erase. Second, it has usually developed over a long period of time and has become an ingrained habit. Third, spiritual forces are involved, so people who want deliverance from homosexual desires need God&#8217;s help.</p>
<p class="bodytext">While a person can make a decision to stop committing homosexual acts, in most cases deliverance from homosexual desires is a long, difficult process. As with all habitual sins, some people seem to experience a more complete eradication of unwholesome desires than others, but those who are delivered should be careful not to expose themselves to unnecessary temptation. Overcoming is accomplished by consistent prayer, walking in the Spirit, disciplining the mind, and obtaining godly support and counsel. The goal should be complete deliverance, which can be obtained through patience, a determination to overcome, and a total love for God. Psalm 37:4 is literally applicable: &#8220;Delight thyself also in the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD; </span>and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">The first step is to cease homosexual activities. The Bible defines homosexuality in terms of practice, so when people stop participating in homosexual acts and stop entertaining homosexual lusts, then they are no longer homosexuals. The <a id="page_190"></a>next step is to seek deliverance from homosexual desires. The third step is for God to give the normal heterosexual desires that He intends for all to have. Those who have fallen into homosexual sin must not accept homosexuality as a basic part of their personality but must realize that it is a learned (whether consciously or unconsciously) habit that can be eradicated.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We should treat homosexuals like anyone else who needs God&#8212;namely, with respect and friendship. We should not look on them with ridicule or contempt, but we should show them Christian love and concern. We do not approve of their conduct, but we accept them as persons. We do not offer condemnation but encouragement and hope. (See John 3:16-17.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Homosexuals may be sincere, hungry for God, and of good moral character in many ways. Often they are extremely lonely and desperate. They usually go through an agonizing period of self-hatred, depression, and despondency until their conscience becomes seared. Our challenge is to reach out to them in love and introduce them to the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Through this experience they will receive power to change. There is no need to exclude them from church services unless they try to entice others in the church to participate in their sin. This danger usually arises from people who claim to be Christians but hide their homosexual behavior and secretly try to involve others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If young men struggle with effeminate tendencies, the pastor, youth pastor, or other approved leader should counsel, guide, and mentor them individually so that they can become more masculine in speech, mannerisms, and dress. In some cases, they simply have lacked appropriate male role models and training. They do not need to be used in leadership unless they make progress in this area. Young women who struggle with masculine tendencies need similar assistance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At the same time, we need to guard against the spirit of suspicion. A man who seems to have some feminine mannerisms may not be homosexual. Just because he is more sensitive <a id="page_191"></a>than most men or more talented in certain areas does not mean he is homosexual. Even if someone struggles with homosexual temptations, he should be respected if he resists them and refuses to act on them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In short, we cannot stereotype people, nor should we assume, insinuate, or charge that someone is guilty of homosexual activity based simply on certain mannerisms. Some very masculine men are homosexual, so appearances can be deceiving. Of course, we should protect our children and youth from unhealthy influences and encounters. Pastors have the responsibility to guard the flock and to warn against sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We can overcome all forms of sexual temptation and sin, including homosexual behavior. Inside everyone is a latent desire for the opposite sex if only the layers of habit and experience can be removed. The Holy Spirit will give the power to overcome. Pastor and friends must patiently offer their support, and the person must pray continually. Most importantly, the person must have a sincere determination to change his or her life and a sincere desire to live for God.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Adultery, fornication, lust, lewdness, pornography, and homosexuality are great dangers today, for the prevailing spirits of the world always attack the church. Pastors must teach and preach against these sins. It is advisable to organize men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s meetings to address these issues. It is also good to hold meetings for youth to discuss dating, intimate embracing and caressing, fornication, homosexuality, and marriage. Some meetings need to be held separately for males and females with appropriate respective teachers such as the pastor and pastor&#8217;s wife. We must meet the challenge of the end time in these areas!</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_192"></a>Resources to assist in overcoming sexual lust, pornography, sexual addiction, and homosexual behavior are available from Focus on the Family,<i> www.pureintimacy.org</i>, and<i> www. beaconministries.net</i> (an Apostolic Web site dealing with homosexuality).</p>
<p class="bodytext">There are many cases of overcomers. Paul told the Corinthians, after listing fornicators, adulterers, homosexuals, and other types of sinners, &#8220;And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God&#8221; (I Corinthians 6:9-11). We can conquer all sin, including sexual sin, through faith in Jesus Christ, heartfelt repentance, baptism in Jesus&#8217; name, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and daily spiritual disciplines as we rely on the power of the Spirit.</p>
