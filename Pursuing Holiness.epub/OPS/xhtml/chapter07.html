<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_113"></a><i>&#8220;The light of the body is the eye. . . . If thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness&#8221; (Matthew 6:22-23).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes&#8221; (Psalm 101:3).</i></p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Gate of the Soul</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">David made a covenant with his eyes when he promised not to place any wicked thing in front of them. He also asked God to &#8220;turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity&#8221; (Psalm 119:37). Vanity refers to anything that is worthless, foolish, empty, and destitute of reality. Why did David place such emphasis on keeping his eyes free from beholding wicked and vain things?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The reason is that the eye is a unique member of the body in certain important respects. Jesus told us that the eye is the light of the body (Matthew 6:22-23; Luke 11:34). If it is &#8220;single&#8221; (clear, whole, not blinded), then the whole body will be full of light. If it is &#8220;evil&#8221; (wicked, diseased, blind), then the whole body will be full of darkness. If the light of the body is dark, how great is the darkness of the rest of the body! In <a id="page_114"></a>other words, Jesus taught that the eye is the gate to the heart or soul. It is the principal sensory organ that we use to receive information from the outside world. If our eye is constantly filled with evil sights, then our thoughts and actions will be drastically affected.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Psychologists have verified this statement, estimating that 90 percent of our thought life is stimulated by what we see. Experiments have shown that the human brain retains in long-term memory about 65 percent of what it receives through the eyes and ears simultaneously but only about 15 percent of what comes through the ears alone. As a simple illustration of the impact of the eyes on the mind, we can think of the difference between seeing a horrible accident as opposed to merely hearing about it. There is much truth in the old saying, &#8220;Seeing is believing.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">What we see has a powerful influence on our thoughts. In turn, our thoughts determine what kind of people we are. &#8220;For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he&#8221; (Proverbs 23:7). As Jesus said, the condition of the eyes determines the condition of the body as a whole. What the eyes indulge in and enjoy is what the body will indulge in and enjoy. For this reason, the &#8220;lust of the eyes&#8221; is one of the three major areas of worldliness and temptation (I John 2:16). While we can be tempted through other senses, the Bible does not speak of the lust of the nose or ears, because their influence is not nearly as significant as that of the eyes.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Temptation is the first step toward sin, and after lust has conceived it brings forth sin (James 1:14-15). Often, temptation comes through the eyes. Eve saw that the forbidden fruit was pleasant to the eye, so she took it (Genesis 3:6). Achan saw a garment, some silver, and some gold. God had forbidden the Israelites from taking anything from Jericho, and no doubt Achan intended to obey, but when he actually saw these objects he explained, &#8220;Then I coveted them&#8221; (Joshua 7:21). David &#8220;saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was <a id="page_115"></a>very beautiful to look upon&#8221; (II Samuel 11:2). This temptation led directly to adultery and eventually murder. Satan showed Jesus the kingdoms of the world from a mountaintop in order to tempt Him (Matthew 4:8). All these incidents show how powerful the eyes can be.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Satan knows that he can easily reach the mind through the eye. He tries to bring temptations before our eyes for several reasons. First, in this way we encounter suggestions we had not previously known about or considered. Second, scenes can become embedded in our memories so that they are available to tempt us later when we are weak or discouraged. Third, constant exposure to certain sights and their associated ideas causes us gradually to become accustomed to them. We may eventually come to accept them as permissible, normal, or inevitable. Finally, if we think about certain things long enough, we will eventually sin&#8212;whether by entertaining and dwelling on these scenes in our minds or by committing an outward act of sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We must guard our eyes from temptations. Of course, many situations present themselves to us and yet we may have little control over them. For example, we may see immodest dress almost anywhere today. What should we as Christians do in this kind of situation? We may not be able to avoid such sights completely, but we can discipline our eyes and minds. We must not entertain, fantasize about, or deliberately pro-long the temptation; for doing so can lead to sin, either in our minds or in our actions.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Scriptural Guidelines for Media</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">There are areas in modern society where we are able to exercise complete control over what we allow our eyes to see; namely, the use of visual media, including both printed <a id="page_116"></a>and electronic materials. Let us look at some passages of Scripture that apply to our use of these media.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As we have discussed, evil can easily enter our minds through our eyes. Thus, whatever we are supposed to keep out of our minds, we should keep away from our eyes. Jesus said, &#8220;For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things which defile a man&#8221; (Matthew 15:19-20). Isaiah 33:15-16 gives this promise: he &#8220;that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; he shall dwell on high.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul commanded, &#8220;Abstain from all appearance of evil&#8221; (I Thessalonians 5:22). After listing twenty-three sins of debased people, he further described them as follows: &#8220;who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them&#8221; (Romans 1:32). Not only is it wrong to commit evil, but it is also wrong to take pleasure in others who commit evil. Thus, we should not entertain ourselves by the depiction and glorification of evil deeds. When we do, we think defiling thoughts. How can we take pleasure in the sins of others and yet fulfill the commandment, &#8220;Ye that love the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD,</span> hate evil&#8221; (Psalm 97:10)? As the psalmist prayed, &#8220;Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O L<span class="smallcaps">ORD&#8221;</span> (Psalm 19:14).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Reading</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Reading is one of the best means of self-education. Someone who loves to read will probably have a large vocabulary, good grammar, and a general knowledge of a variety of topics. Reading helps to keep the mind active. It can be a valuable source for intelligent conversation, preaching, and <a id="page_117"></a>teaching. There are many good books and magazines, both fiction and nonfiction.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At the same time, some reading material is not suitable for Christians. Examples are novels that glorify immorality or violence, explicit and graphic descriptions of sex, books filled with obscene and blasphemous words, pornographic magazines, magazines that focus on intimate confessions and scandals, and books that deal with witchcraft and the occult. If we feed on this type of material, then we will not have clean hearts. We must put away such books from our lives and destroy those in our possession, as did the church in Ephesus (Acts 19:19). If we read certain descriptions and absorb certain scenes, we plant them in our heart, and eventually they will proceed out of the heart.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If in doubt about whether to read something or not, we can ask: Are these meditations acceptable in the sight of God? The Holy Spirit will guide us in specific situations. Let us be sensitive to the Spirit and to the impressions He gives. We also have the laws of God written upon our hearts by faith, so our conscience, as informed by Scripture, can be a helpful guide. When we begin to read something that is unwholesome, the Holy Spirit can impress us not to continue. If we continue, our conscience will bother us. At that point, we have power either to suppress the voice of conscience or to obey it and do God&#8217;s will.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some say that novels are frivolous and unwholesome, but the reading of fiction can be a valid form of recreation and refreshment. Moreover, good fiction can stimulate thought, impart information, and increase language skills. Some types of fiction, such as comic books, may have little or no informative or educational value. It is advisable to limit the reading of this type of material and for parents to monitor and control its use.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_118"></a>Viewing</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Technology has created many forms of visual media, including television programing, movies and digital media delivered via the Internet, video games, CDs, DVDs, smart phones, and tablets. These media are a major area of concern in our day with respect to the lust of the eyes. As Christians, we should carefully regulate all use of media. While entertainment is not wrong, we must exercise great care when seeking entertainment in modern culture.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In making these decisions, we seek to implement the teachings of Psalm 101:2-3: &#8220;I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.&#8221; While we cannot prevent all temptations from coming to us, we should exercise control in areas of our own responsibility, especially the home. We also seek to follow Romans 1:32, which teaches that people who take pleasure in watching others commit sin are guilty of sin as well.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Technology is rapidly changing, leading to a proliferation of new choices and a merging with old choices. Thus, each generation needs to evaluate the situation in its day in order to make responsible Christian choices.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The scope of the problem becomes clear when we see the results of a 2012 report commissioned by the Dove Foundation. Covering the top 1,000 movies released from 2005-2009, this study shows that 38 percent were rated R; 41 percent, PG-13; 18 percent, PG; and only 3 percent were rated G.</p>
<p class="bodytext">With regard to other digital media such as DVDs and the Internet we recognize that there is greater ability to make and regulate choices, so that people can choose to watch things that are wholesome, beneficial, inspirational, or educational. <a id="page_119"></a>However, whatever is objectionable to watch on television or in movie theaters is objectionable to watch using these media. In all use of technology, we should only allow ourselves to view things that are consistent with family and Christian values. We also need to consider and follow the admonition of our pastor in this area. In all cases, parents should communicate clear guidelines to their children and personally monitor their viewing activities. Some good questions to ask are: Would I be comfortable showing this at church? Would I be willing to invite the pastor to watch with me?</p>
<p class="bodytext">For Internet use, we recommend placing the computer in a common area where its use can easily be seen by others and using a filtering program to block unwholesome sites. As a safeguard, parents should be able to monitor children&#8217;s use, and a spouse should be able to monitor a spouse&#8217;s use. It is wise for parents to instruct children to obtain their permission whenever they wish to use the Internet.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In selecting various visual media, we should carefully research their appropriateness for Christian viewing. Filtering guards can eliminate the occasional, unexpected use of inappropriate language. Detailed reviews are available online to assist in making wise decisions. Appropriate versions can also be purchased online from Christian or family-oriented companies.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For video games, we have instructed our children not to play anything that involves their killing of humans, that graphically depicts bloodshed, or that promotes immorality. We monitor both content and use of time. A rating of T (teen) indicates content that is potentially inappropriate, while M (mature) and A (adult) are clearly contrary to Christian values.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>The problem with television, movies, and other media.</b> The kinds of things displayed on the screen are generally not conducive to Christian living. Violence and sex are the two most common topics. Immodest clothing, assault, adultery, fornication, lying, hatred, cursing, drinking, smoking, filthy <a id="page_120"></a>speech, and murder are among the evils shown almost constantly. This list sounds remarkably like the things in Matthew 15:19-20 that defile a person. Most of the programming consists of activities in which Christians should not participate. The scriptural admonitions, &#8220;I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes,&#8221; &#8220;Abstain from all appearance of evil,&#8221; and &#8220;Let the meditation of my heart be acceptable,&#8221; are all applicable. How can we profess to hate evil if we indulge in watching these scenes? How can we avoid the condemnation of Romans 1:32 on those who take pleasure in watching others sin?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The viewer is bombarded with evil scenes and ungodly behavior. This evil goes directly from the eyes to the heart or mind. The result is to undermine resistance to sin. The mind is constantly tempted and encouraged to sin. By seeing sin repeated over and over, the mind becomes desensitized and gradually comes to the conclusion that it is not so bad after all. Viewers subconsciously assume that society in general is similar to what they see on the screen and that everyone else is living that way. The result is a compromising and permissive attitude.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As psychologists verify, television and movies are a form of escapism. The mind subconsciously identifies with the actors and plays their roles as a means of escaping the drudgery of life. Thus, the viewer&#8217;s mind is polluted by participating vicariously in unwholesome scenes. In short, television and movies are a source of temptation and pollution of the heart or mind. They gradually erode defenses and alter attitudes toward sin through subtle influences. They entertain the carnal nature and feed the lusts of the flesh. Constant viewing of the standard fare of television and movies undermines spirituality.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Medical doctors, psychologists, sociologists, and social commentators have researched the effects of television on the human mind, especially on the mind of children. The following sources report some of these findings and describe the <a id="page_121"></a>power and danger of television from a secular point of view. Although the comments are directed primarily toward television, they apply to other visual media when used in the same manner.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Michael and Diane Medved, authors of<i> Saving Childhood, </i>offer commentary on media in the home. The authors are a Jewish couple; he is a radio talk show host and former film critic, while she is a psychologist in private practice. They describe how modern culture destroys the innocence of childhood, leading to much of the dysfunctional and destructive behaviors in society today. In response, parents need to protect their children from these assaults and provide children with security, a sense of wonder, and optimism (faith).</p>
<p class="bodytext">According to the A.C. Nielsen Company, the average American watches more than twenty-eight hours of television a week. This is the equivalent of nine uninterrupted<i> years</i> of a sixty-five-year life. Some studies show that by age five a child will have spent more time watching TV than talking to his or her father in a<i> lifetime.</i> The Medveds conclude: &#8220;Our strongest suggestion for maintaining your kids&#8217; sense of wonder is<i> cut out&#8212;or cut down on</i>&#8212;TV. . . . The problem is not too much sex or too much sleaze or too much violence,<i> it&#8217;s too much TV&#8212;period.&#8221;</i> Their solution is as follows:</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Medved family has never owned a TV. . . . Upon proposing to Diane, Michael had one potentially deal-breaking stipulation: no TV. . . . We do own a video monitor, however, though absence of any antenna or cable makes TV reception impossible. We allow our three children to watch selected and approved videos that we own or rent, up to six hours a week.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Internet usage is even more prevalent with the Pew Research Center reporting that 81 percent of all American adults (eighteen years old and up) and 95 percent of all American teens use the Internet with social interaction taking up most of their time. A 2009 Harris poll reported that 14 percent of adult Internet users spent over twenty-four hours a <a id="page_122"></a>week on the Internet while eight to eighteen year olds spend an average of 53 hours a week on the Internet. These statistics underscore the need to guard against excessive use of media and its potential to steer individuals and families away from other Christian priorities.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Summary</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">We have abundant evidence of the adverse spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical effects of unwholesome media programing. It feeds the lusts of the flesh, is a constant source of temptation, is a thief of time, harms family life, damages children&#8217;s character and morals, promotes sin, and is psychologically detrimental. Under these circumstances, Christians are better off without its influence. As technology continues to change and new options and new circumstances develop, Christians should carefully regulate all use of visual media in accordance with Christian values.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What is the position of Christians who habitually watch worldly programming on television and other media? Do they still hate evil? Apparently, their love is in the wrong place. This position is dangerous, for &#8220;if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him&#8221; (I John 2:15). If we bring unwholesome programs into the home through television, the Internet, and other media, it will be difficult for us to mind the things of the Spirit and to maintain a close walk with God. Worldly programming will sap our power with God and subtly influence us in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since not all content is sinful, we cannot say that watching one program is necessarily a sin, but regular viewing can be detrimental or dangerous. Because much of the content is sinful, frequent viewing is likely to lead to sin, for it is difficult to avoid all inappropriate content when it is so readily available. <a id="page_123"></a>It is sinful to indulge in carnal lusts and to take pleasure in evil.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We should note the importance of following personal convictions in this area. Whatever is not of faith is sin (Romans 14:23), and a knowing failure to do what is good is sin (James 4:17). We should also heed the words of the wise man in Ecclesiastes 7:29: &#8220;God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.&#8221;</p>
