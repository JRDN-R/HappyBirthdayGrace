<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;If a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him[.] But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering&#8221; (I Corinthians 11:14-15).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1"><a id="page_143"></a>Just as the Bible provides direction for how we can dress in a way that glorifies God, it also directs in how the way we wear our hair can be an act of worship. We find the New Testament teaching about hair in I Corinthians 11:1-16. This passage teaches that a woman should have long, uncut hair and a man should have short hair. At the outset, let us briefly summarize the reasons for this teaching.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Reasons Why a Woman Should Have Long Hair</b></h3>
<p class="hanga">1.&#160;&#160;Long hair is a sign of her submission to authority.</p>
<p class="hanga">2.&#160;&#160;The angels are watching to see if she has this sign.</p>
<p class="hanga">3.&#160;&#160;It is a shame for a woman to pray or prophesy with an uncovered head, for she thereby dishonors her head (leadership). Long hair is her symbolic head covering. If she shears (cuts) her hair it is like shaving her head.</p>
<p class="hanga">4.&#160;&#160;<a id="page_144"></a>Nature teaches her to have long hair as opposed to shorn (cut) hair or a shaved head.</p>
<p class="hanga">5.&#160;&#160;Long hair is a woman&#8217;s glory.</p>
<p class="hanga">6.&#160;&#160;It is one of God&#8217;s methods for maintaining a distinction between male and female.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Reasons Why a Man Should Have Short Hair</b></h3>
<p class="hanga">1.&#160;&#160;Short hair on a man is a symbol of leadership and his submission to Christ&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<p class="hanga">2.&#160;&#160;A man who prays or prophesies with his head covered by long hair dishonors his head (leadership), which is Christ.</p>
<p class="hanga">3.&#160;&#160;Nature teaches him to have short hair.</p>
<p class="hanga">4.&#160;&#160;Long hair is a shame on a man.</p>
<p class="hanga">5.&#160;&#160;It is one of God&#8217;s methods for maintaining a distinction between male and female.</p>
<p class="bodytext1">To fully understand and appreciate these reasons, we need to look at the significance of hair in the Old Testament. The Old Testament was written for our learning, example, and admonition (Romans 15:4; I Corinthians 10:11). The law served as a schoolmaster to bring people to Christ (Galatians 3:24). The Old Testament contains many types and shadows that help us to appreciate and understand the meaning of the New Testament (Colossians 2:16-17; Hebrews 8:5; 10:1).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Hair in the Old Testament</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Hair was a symbol of perfection and strength.</i></b> Among the Jews, an abundance of hair indicated perfection and strength. Lack of hair symbolized the opposite: imperfection, lost glory, and powerlessness. For example, the young <a id="page_145"></a>men in II Kings 2:23 contemptuously called Elisha a bald head. This expression did not necessarily indicate actual baldness but meant that the person so called was worthless, imperfect, and without glory.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Cutting of hair was a symbol of disgrace or mourning.</i></b> Throughout the Old Testament, the cutting of hair symbolized disgrace (Ezra 9:3; Nehemiah 13:25) or mourning (Isaiah 22:12; Ezekiel 27:31; 29:18; Micah 1:16). The loss of hair signified barrenness, sin, and the judgment of God (Isaiah 3:17, 24; 15:2; Jeremiah 47:5; 48:37; Ezekiel 7:18; Amos 8:10). In Isaiah 3:17-24, the judgment pronounced on proud women was that instead of having well-set hair they would be struck bald by God. In essence, they would be without honor and would be ashamed. In Jeremiah 7:29, God used cut hair as a symbol of Judah&#8217;s backslidden condition and her rejection by God.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Hair was a symbol of glory.</i></b> A woman&#8217;s long hair symbolizes the blessings of God in Ezekiel 16:7. Gray hair is a crown of glory (Proverbs 16:31). God told Ezekiel to cut his hair as an object lesson of God&#8217;s judgment on Judah (Ezekiel 5:1-4, 12). He then showed Ezekiel that His glory would depart from the Temple in Jerusalem (Ezekiel 10:3-10). Ezekiel without hair signified Ezekiel without glory, which in turn symbolized Jerusalem without the glory of God.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Uncut hair was a mark of separation unto God. </i></b>When we study the vow of the Nazarites (or, more accurately, Nazirites), we discover that hair could be a mark of separation (Numbers 6:1-21). According to Strong&#8217;s Concordance this name comes from the Hebrew<i> nazir,</i> which means &#8220;separate, i.e. consecrated.&#8221; The Nazarites were separated unto Jehovah as shown by three outward signs. A Nazarite was not to partake of grapes or any product of grapes, was not to touch a corpse, and was not to cut the hair on the head. This last sign was the only one that immediately identified a Nazarite by outward appearance.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_146"></a>Either a man or a woman could be a Nazarite (verse 2). The Nazarite vow could be taken for a temporary period or for a lifetime. Paul took temporary vows, while Samson was a Nazarite from his mother&#8217;s womb (Acts 21:20-27; Judges 13:7). Since abundance of hair signified strength, perfection, and glory, the free growth of hair on the head represented the dedication of all one&#8217;s strength and power to God. The hair was &#8220;the consecration of his God upon his head&#8221; (Numbers 6:7).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Nazarites could not cut their hair at all, but they let it grow. During their period of separation they were holy. At the end of the vow they cut their hair (verse 5). The reason they could not defile themselves by touching a corpse was that the mark of their separation was on their head for all to see (verse 7). If Nazarites broke their vow by becoming defiled, they had to shave their head (verse 9). The reason is that their long hair would signify that they were still separated, while their actions proved otherwise. Their appearance and actions would be in conflict.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If Nazarites broke their vow, they had to begin all over again (verse 12). Their prior commitment was not counted if the vow was broken. (See also Ezekiel 3:20; 18:24; 33:12-13.) When the vow was completed, their hair was cut and put on the altar for a peace offering (verse 18). It was called the hair of separation unto God (verse 19).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Each seventh year in Israel was called a sabbatical year. Trees and vines were not pruned, and fields were not plowed or sown. In particular, grape vines were left undressed (Leviticus 25:5, 11). In Hebrew, the word &#8220;undressed&#8221; is<i> nazir,</i> the same word translated as &#8220;Nazarite&#8221; in Numbers. In fact, a second definition of this word is &#8220;an unpruned vine (like an unshorn Nazarite).&#8221; These &#8220;Nazarite&#8221; vines were not cut or pruned but were allowed to grow freely, just like the Nazarites&#8217; hair.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In summary, in the Old Testament hair was often a symbol of power, perfection, and glory. The absence of hair could signify worthlessness and glory departed. Christians today are not Nazarites in the literal sense, but our study has shown that <a id="page_147"></a>the hair of the Nazarites was a visible mark of separation from the world and consecration to God.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>New Testament Teaching</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">We now turn to the New Testament teaching on hair as found in I Corinthians 11:1-16. Most denominational churches ignore this passage, concluding that it does not apply today. Some interpret it to mean that women must pray with some type of cloth on their heads. Most conservative churches at one time taught women to have long hair, and some continue to do so today.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Since all Scripture is given by the inspiration of God (II Timothy 3:16), we should not ignore any passage of Scripture, for each is precious and important. We should especially heed instructions to the New Testament church, for we are part of that church. Let us analyze this passage of Scripture in that light.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verses 1-2.</i> Paul admonished believers to follow him and to keep the ordinances or teachings that he had delivered to them. Among these ordinances is his teaching concerning hair in the subsequent verses.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verse 3.</i> God is the head of Christ. As a human, Jesus submitted to the eternal Spirit of God that dwelt in Him, thereby setting an example for us. Christ subjected His flesh to the plan and purpose of God, even unto death (Philippians 2:8).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Similarly, Christ is the head of the man, and the man is the head of the woman. God intends for the man to be the leader of the family. He is to be the spiritual representative of the home. In the beginning, God held Adam primarily accountable for human sinfulness. The sins of fathers particularly affect children (Exodus 20:5). Moreover, a woman is to respect the leadership of her own husband (Ephesians 5:22; Colossians 3:18; I Peter 3:1).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i><a id="page_148"></a>Verse 4.</i> A man should not have his head covered when he prays or prophesies. If he does, he dishonors his head or leader, namely, Christ. Prophesying includes any anointed preaching and testimony.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verse 5.</i> A woman who prays or prophesies (including preaching and testimony) with her head uncovered dishonors her head or leader, which is the man. In other words, the sexes should not try to change places. The woman&#8217;s covering is a sign of her role in God&#8217;s plan. According to verse 15, long hair is the symbolic covering that God has given her, and according to verse 6 it should be unshorn or uncut.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verse 6.</i> If a woman is not going to cover her head (by letting her hair grow long), then this is equivalent to cutting off her hair. But this is a disgrace or a shame to her. It signifies the taking away of her glory in God&#8217;s sight. Since it is a shame for her hair to be shorn (cut) or shaved, she should be covered (let her hair grow long).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verses 7-9.</i> Adam was created in the image of God and subsequently Eve was also (Genesis 1:26-27). The man is the representative of the family before God, with the authority and responsibility to provide for his family, protect his family, and lead his family spiritually. As a sign of his position, his head should not be covered (with long hair, verse 14). The woman originally came from the man (Genesis 2:22). She is his partner, a helper comparable to him (Genesis 2:20), who respects his position and follows his godly leadership. Woman is the crowning glory of man. To demonstrate this relationship, her head should be covered (verse 6) with her glory, which is her long hair (verse 15). In short, male and female are equally important in God&#8217;s plan, but their roles are distinct, and God wants this distinction to be displayed and preserved outwardly by their hair.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verse 10.</i> The angels are involved with this subject, as they observe the obedience or disobedience of humans to God&#8217;s plan. The angels desire to look into our salvation (I <a id="page_149"></a>Peter 1:12). Pride and rebellion caused the fall of Satan and many angels (I Timothy 3:6; Isaiah 14:12-15). Thus, a woman should have &#8220;power&#8221; on her head as an example to the angels. The Greek word here is<i> exousia,</i> meaning &#8220;authority,&#8221; and in this context it indicates a mark or sign of authority. The angels look to see if women have the sign of consecration, submission, and power with God, or if they are rebellious like Satan. Women&#8217;s hair shows the angels whether or not the church is submissive to Christ, the head of the church.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verses 11-12.</i> Women are not inferior to men, and men are not complete without women. Both depend on each other. This principle of complementarity and interdependence is especially true in the church. The roles are different, however, and God has designated the man to be the leader of the family.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verse 13.</i> Paul used a question as a part of his teaching method. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered? His answer is no; it is a shame for her to do so (verse 5).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verse 14.</i> Nature, not just custom, teaches a man to have short hair but a woman to have long hair. Since God is the Creator of nature, the teaching of nature in this situation comes from God. God&#8217;s purpose is to make a distinction of gender in this area.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verse 15.</i> A woman&#8217;s hair is given for her glory and for a covering to satisfy the requirements of the preceding verses. This verse does not mention any other covering such as a hat or scarf. It would be difficult for a woman to put on a scarf every time she prays or witnesses to someone, especially if she prays without ceasing (I Thessalonians 5:17). This verse explains that a woman does not have to wear a veil of cloth; her hair is sufficient covering.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Greek word for &#8220;have long hair&#8221; here is<i> koma&#333;,</i> which means &#8220;wear long hair, let one&#8217;s hair grow long&#8221;or &#8220;wear tresses of hair.&#8221; The word for &#8220;covered&#8221; in verse 6 is<i> katakalupt&#333;, </i>meaning &#8220;to cover wholly, i.e., to veil.&#8221; The word for &#8220;covering&#8221; in verse 15 is<i> peribolaion,</i> which is &#8220;something thrown <a id="page_150"></a>around one, i.e., a mantle, veil.&#8221; Thus, verses 5-6 teach that a woman&#8217;s head should be covered wholly or veiled. Verse 15 says her hair is a mantle or veil; it is a symbolic article of apparel for the head. Clearly, long hair is the covering that meets the requirements of verses 5, 6, and 13.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Verse 16.</i> The people of God are not contentious. The church has no custom of being contentious over the teachings of God&#8217;s Word. It has no custom regarding hair other than what Paul had just described. Some say this verse means that if anyone disagrees with these teachings, obedience is not required. If this were true, however, Paul&#8217;s entire teaching in this section would be in vain, and he would be condoning contention and disobedience. Paul would not say, &#8220;If you do not have such a custom, then you are not required to obey the Word of God and the ordinances of the church.&#8221; Reading verses 2 and 16 together, the message is that we should obey these teachings instead of being contentious.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Reasons for Biblical Teaching on Hair</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Hair symbolizes the relationship of husband and wife, which in turn represents the Lord&#8217;s relationship with the church. A woman&#8217;s long hair symbolizes that she submits to God&#8217;s plan and to the family leadership of her husband. It is her glory. It is a sign to the angels of her commitment to God and her power with God. It is a covering so that she can pray and prophesy publicly without being ashamed. Similarly, a man&#8217;s short hair symbolizes that he submits to God&#8217;s plan and accepts the family leadership position.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nature teaches women to let their hair grow long and men to cut their hair short. First, nature teaches that there should be a visible distinction between male and female. Second, in almost all cultures, men have worn short hair in comparison to women. Third, men are ten times more likely to go bald <a id="page_151"></a>than women. It is natural for a man not to have any hair but unnatural for a woman not to have hair. Therefore, when men and women follow the biblical teaching on hair, they follow God&#8217;s plan as established in creation. Hair length makes a gender distinction, which God considers to be important. (See Deuteronomy 22:5.) It is also a mark of separation from the world. (See chapter 8.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">God always gives us a choice to do His will or not. He never forces us to be what He wants us to be. We did not choose to be male or female, however; that choice was determined for us at conception. By our choice of dress and hairstyle, we show acceptance or rejection of God&#8217;s plan for us as male or female, husband or wife, father or mother. The roles are equally important in family, church, and society, but they are different. God wants us to demonstrate our willingness to accept the roles He has chosen for us.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The relationship between husband and wife is like that between Christ and the church. The husband is the head of the wife as Christ is head of the church (Ephesians 5:22-23). Therefore, when Christian men and women demonstrate their acceptance of God&#8217;s plan by their hair, they also demonstrate the church&#8217;s submission to Christ.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>How Long Is Long?</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Our study of the Nazarites indicates that long hair as a mark of separation means uncut hair or hair that is allowed to grow freely. By letting the hair grow freely, women allow nature, the teacher that Paul appealed to in I Corinthians 11:14, to determine the proper length for each individual. The Greek word for long hair in verse 15 means that a woman should let her hair grow long. Moreover, verse 6 indicates that if a woman cuts her hair, it is the same as if she shaves her head. The Bible does not provide any other definition <a id="page_152"></a>for long hair on women, nor does it designate any particular measurement as long. The point is not to grow it to a certain length, because different individuals&#8217; hair naturally grows to different lengths. If a woman does not cut her hair, then it is long in God&#8217;s sight. Finally, the fundamental principle is that a woman&#8217;s hair needs to be visibly longer than that of men.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A man&#8217;s hair should be at least short enough to distinguish him from women. This length may vary somewhat in various ages and cultures. In determining the appropriate length of a man&#8217;s hair we should consider the following questions. Is it shorter than that of the average woman in our society? Is it a good witness, or is it a reproach to the church and to Christ? Is it a sign of rebellion against authority in the community or in the church? Is it a stumbling block or an offense to other members of the church? (See I Corinthians 8:9-13.) Does it identify him with elements of the world from which he has been saved?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Under certain cultural circumstances, all but the first of these questions could apply to facial hair also. Whether shaved or allowed to grow, a man&#8217;s beard is a sign of masculinity. In general, facial hair was highly regarded in the Bible and in many other times and cultures, but in white, middle-class America of the 1960s it became a sign of rebellion. In the Bible, we find positive examples both of shaving and growing beards. (See Genesis 41:14; Psalm 133:2.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">The notion that Jesus had long, womanly hair is a myth. He was not a Nazarite as some believe, but a Nazarene, which means an inhabitant of the city of Nazareth. He drank the fruit of the vine and touched corpses, so He did not have a Nazarite vow. The art that shows Him with long hair was painted many centuries later and is without scriptural or historical foundation. It reflects medieval rather than biblical customs. Roman sculpture and coinage as well as other historical sources show that men generally wore short hair in Christ&#8217;s day. In any case, He would not have worn womanly hair in contradiction to the Word of God.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_153"></a>Attitudes</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">There are two concerns regarding a woman&#8217;s attitude toward long hair. Some may resent the need to care for and fix long hair. But with moderate effort it is possible to fix long hair so that it looks modern, neat, and attractive. Many promise to do anything for the Lord, yet when it comes to long hair, they are unwilling to make the effort. Since God has made His wishes clear, disobeying Him demonstrates self-centeredness, a lack of consecration, and a lack of love.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Another danger is pride. It is possible to take the very hair that is supposed to be a sign of submission and arrange it in an ostentatious display. Overly elaborate hairdos and extravagant hairpieces draw attention to self rather than the message of the long hair. Such ostentation undermines the purpose and testimony of the long hair. Many people have been impressed with the beautiful, holy, long hair of Christian women, but others have been perplexed, confused, and repelled by showy displays.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Thus I Timothy 2:9 warns women not to adorn themselves with &#8220;broided hair,&#8221; which, according to the Amplified Bible, includes &#8220;[elaborate] hair arrangement.&#8221; We find the same admonition in I Peter 3:3. Both verses refer to elaborate hair arrangement in the first century, such as braiding the hair with a string of pearls or with gold coins attached to silk cords. We must exercise moderation and temperance in all things, including hair arrangement. It would be a shame for a woman to undermine the message of holiness with something intended to be a sign of holiness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Shall We Obey I Corinthians 11:1-16?</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">We cannot treat this passage casually, merely because we think it is outdated or inconvenient. If we ignore it, then what <a id="page_154"></a>is to prevent us from ignoring the teaching about communion in the same chapter or any other passage of Scripture?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some may consider disobedience in this matter to be a minor thing. No doubt Moses thought it was a minor thing to disobey God by striking a rock to obtain water instead of speaking to the rock. After all, he had stricken a rock to obtain water once before at God&#8217;s command. Yet God did not allow him to enter the Promised Land because he did not obey His instruction to speak to the rock on the second occasion. (See Exodus 17:6; Numbers 20:7-12.) In God&#8217;s plan, the rock represented Christ (I Corinthians 10:4), who was smitten once for us and whose grace is now available whenever we simply speak His name in faith. Although Moses had no way of understanding this significance, he should have simply obeyed God&#8217;s plan, and he paid a severe price for not doing so. It is always important to obey God&#8217;s Word in all things.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Regardless of personal inconvenience or the opinions of others, it is our responsibility and privilege to serve God. Doing so is the very definition of true love. Jesus said, &#8220;If you love me, keep my commandments&#8221; (John 14:15).</p>
