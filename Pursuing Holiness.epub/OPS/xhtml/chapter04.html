<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;The just shall live by faith&#8221; (Galatians 3:11).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance&#8221; (Galatians 5:22-23)</i>.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Basic Concepts of Christian Living</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">When Christians talk about holiness, it is easy to emphasize rules, regulations, do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts. In a book of this kind it is difficult to be specific, plain, and honest without running the risk of seeming legalistic. This chapter attempts to put things in proper perspective by describing the basic nature of the Christian walk. The Christian life is one of faith and liberty, not one of legalism or drudgery. Instead of merely trying not to do wrong, we are trying to bear fruit pleasing to God. Simply put, we want to imitate Christ. This chapter will define the essence of the Christian experience: namely, that the Christian experience is one of personal freedom from sin and the law, that it is a life of personal consecration to God, and that we display holiness by imitating the life of Christ and by bearing the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The first reason for holiness is to please God, for His sake. He purchased us with His own blood, and we belong not to ourselves but to Him (I Corinthians 6:19-20; I Peter 1:18-19). <a id="page_66"></a>Therefore, we cannot live to ourselves, but we must live unto Christ (II Corinthians 5:15). The second reason for holiness is to communicate Christ to others. We attract and win others to Him by the example of our lives. The third reason for holiness is for our own benefit. The Christian life of holiness is the best plan for our lives. It will benefit us both now and in the life to come.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Work of the Spirit</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The Spirit baptizes us into the body of Christ (I Corinthians 12:13) and adopts us into the family of God (Romans 8:15-16). In other words, the Spirit gives us a new identity. We are transformed by the indwelling Spirit of Christ&#8212;Christ in us (Romans 8:9; Colossians 1:27). We put on the mind of Christ (I Corinthians 2:16; Philippians 2:5). Christ is formed in us (Galatians 4:19). The Spirit of God conforms us to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29). We are able to live holy lives by letting the mind, personality, and will of Jesus Christ supersede our own. Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three years to give us an example to follow (I Peter 2:21-24). He died and rose again to defeat sin and death and to give us power to follow His example (Romans 8:3-4).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness means letting the Spirit and personality of Christ shine through us. We want to display His Spirit. We want to please Him and be like Him. We want to live as He lived and do what He would do. We want to manifest the characteristics and traits of Jesus Christ. In this way we become living examples of Christianity. We become open letters from Christ to the world, written by the Spirit (II Corinthians 3:2-3). The good works that He produces in us will lead people to God, and they will glorify Him.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_67"></a>Christian Characteristics</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">What are the characteristics that Christians (Christ-like people) display? Galatians 5:22-23 gives us an excellent list, known as the fruit of the Spirit. If we have the Spirit in us, we will bear this fruit. While speaking in other tongues is the initial evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit, the abiding evidence that the Holy Spirit dwells in a life is the manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit. Paul listed nine aspects of spiritual fruit: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. Peter listed eight qualities that will make us fruitful in Christ: faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity (II Peter 1:5-10). Faith and temperance are repeated in both lists. Virtue and godliness are aspects of goodness, brotherly kindness and charity are aspects of love, and patience is similar to longsuffering. Peter also noted some characteristics of Christ for us to imitate (I Peter 2:21-24). The passage explains that Christ had no sin or guile (deceit) and describes His love, patience, temperance, and faith while suffering for our sins. This is the fruit God wants us to bear, and this is the fruit that will attract sinners to the gospel message.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Love</i></b> is the most basic element of our Christian life. It is the only acceptable motivation for serving God. We are commanded to love our fellow Christians, to love our neighbors, and even to love our enemies. If we do not love our fellow humans, then we do not love God. If we love the world, then we do not love God. Love is the test of true Christianity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If we understand what love really means, we can fulfill the Bible&#8217;s teaching on holiness. For example, love one for another will eliminate jealousy, strife, talebearing, complaining, and bitterness. Love for God will eliminate worldliness and rebellion. On the other hand, if we do not love both God and people, then nothing will make us right in the sight of God. Correct doctrines and good works cannot take the place <a id="page_68"></a>of love. The closer to God we become, the more love we will have.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Joy.</i></b> As with the other aspects of spiritual fruit, we receive joy from the Holy Spirit. Our experience with God is &#8220;joy unspeakable and full of glory&#8221; (I Peter 1:8). We can have God&#8217;s joy no matter what happens to us. This joy is different from what the world gives, for it is not dependent on circumstances. Regardless of external conditions, we can always rejoice in our salvation and in the God of our salvation (Luke 10:20; Habakkuk 3:17-18). Joy is a weapon and a source of strength. When discouragement comes, we can draw upon the joy of the Spirit. The way to overcome in time of trial is to &#8220;count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations&#8221; (James 1:2). We can praise our way to victory.</p>
<p class="bodytext">How do we obtain joy in time of need? Our salvation itself is a source of joy. &#8220;Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Praise the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD&#8221;</span> (Isaiah 12:3-4). Psalms tells us about two other sources of joy. &#8220;They that sow in tears shall reap in joy&#8221; (Psalm 126:5). If we plant good seed with tears and prayers, we will reap good results with joy. &#8220;In thy presence is fulness of joy&#8221; (Psalm 16:11). When we draw close to God and enter into His presence, we have perfect joy. We can enter into His presence with singing, thanksgiving, and praise (Psalm 100).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Peace.</i></b> We also have peace in the Holy Spirit&#8212;peace that passes all understanding and peace about which the world knows nothing (Romans 14:17; Philippians 4:7). No matter what happens, we can have inner peace. Jesus said, &#8220;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid&#8221; (John 14:27).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Not only can we have peace of mind but also peace with others. In fact, God expects this of us. &#8220;Follow peace with all men&#8221; (Hebrews 12:14). Jesus said, &#8220;Blessed are the peace-makers&#8221;&#8212;those who make peace where there is no peace, <a id="page_69"></a>those who bring peace to a troubled person or a troubled situation (Matthew 5:9).</p>
<p class="bodytext">How can we acquire and maintain peace in our lives? We will have perfect peace if we focus our minds on God and trust Him. &#8220;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee&#8221; (Isaiah 26:3). We experience peace as we rejoice in the Lord, live in moderation (gentleness), lay aside anxiety, and make our requests known to God through prayer and supplication with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:4-7).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Longsuffering or patience</i></b> is important in our Christian experience. Jesus said, &#8220;In your patience possess ye your souls&#8221; (Luke 21:19). We bear fruit with patience (Luke 8:15), we run our race with patience (Hebrews 12:1), and we obtain promises by faith and patience (Hebrews 6:12). &#8220;For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise&#8221; (Hebrews 10:36).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Longsuffering connotes patience or forbearance in relationships with people. Paul implored us to walk worthy of our calling, &#8220;with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace&#8221; (Ephesians 4:2-3). Longsuffering comes with meekness, love, a desire for unity, and a desire for peace. Patience comes by the trying of faith and by tribulation (Romans 5:3; James 1:3). If we let patience have its perfect work, we will have experience, hope, and everything else that we need (Romans 5:4; James 1:4).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Gentleness</i></b> is not the same as weakness. To be gentle is to be courteous, mannerly, kind, patient, serene, and not harsh, violent, or rough. Jesus was gentle in dealing with people, yet He was firm and decisive when necessary. The Lord wants us to be gentle toward everyone (II Timothy 2:24). His gentleness will make us great (Psalm 18:35).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Goodness.</i></b> This word includes righteousness, morality, virtue, and excellence. We must remember that &#8220;there is none <a id="page_70"></a>good but one, that is, God&#8221; (Mark 10:18). Any good thing we have comes from Him (James 1:17). All our righteousness is as filthy rags in His sight (Isaiah 64:6); only the righteousness of Christ saves us. When we have faith in Jesus, we receive His righteousness (Romans 4:5-6). We are saved as we continue in God&#8217;s goodness (Romans 11:22).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Faith.</i></b> Not only do we need faith to be saved, but we need faith to continue our Christian walk. Without faith it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6). Faith causes us to realize that all things work together for good to those who love God (Romans 8:28). Faith assures us God will never allow us to be tempted more than we can bear and that He will always provide a way of escape (I Corinthians 10:13). Faith results in answered prayer, supplied needs, and fulfilled promises. &#8220;And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive&#8221; (Matthew 21:22). This aspect of spiritual fruit involves faithfulness, which means being loyal, true, constant, and consistent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">How do we receive faith? God has given a measure of faith to everyone (Romans 12:3). Surely we have as much faith as a grain of mustard seed, and if we will exercise this much faith, nothing will be impossible (Matthew 17:20). We build faith primarily by hearing the preaching and teaching of God&#8217;s Word and by reading the promises of God&#8217;s Word (Romans 10:17). We can also increase our faith by hearing the testimonies of others and by drawing upon our own past experiences with God. Faith can also come in a critical moment as a supernatural gift of the Spirit (I Corinthians 12:9).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Meekness.</i></b> To be meek means to be patient, mild, and not inclined to anger or resentment. It does not mean weakness or spinelessness. Meekness includes humility&#8212;a realization that we are nothing without God and that we must have His help. Meekness is an important quality for leaders to have. Moses was the meekest man in his day, and Jesus described Himself as meek and lowly. Jesus said that the meek would inherit the <a id="page_71"></a>earth (Matthew 5:5). The Lord wants us to show meekness to everyone (Titus 3:2).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Here are some things the Bible says should be done with meekness: preaching the Word (II Corinthians 10:1), receiving the Word (James 1:21), helping and restoring an erring brother (Galatians 6:1), displaying wisdom (James 3:13), and adorning our lives (I Peter 3:4). Meekness is an attitude we must consciously develop in ourselves. It takes effort on our part. &#8220;Submit yourselves therefore to God. . . . Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord&#8221; (James 4:7, 10).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Temperance</i></b> encompasses self-restraint, self-control, and moderation. Any pleasure can become painful if carried to excess, and any good thing can be ruined by taking it to extremes. In I Corinthians 9:24-27 Paul illustrated the concept of temperance by a runner in a race. To win, runners must be &#8220;temperate in all things.&#8221; They must have discipline and self-control. They must have a well-balanced training program and must be moderate in their activities. Likewise, Paul had discipline and control. He knew what his goal was, and he kept his body under subjection. Temperance or self-control is an attribute that we need to display at all times.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Church Meetings</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">At the first general conference of the church (Acts 15), an important, controversial issue was decided&#8212;namely, what practices of the Jewish law are mandatory for Gentile Christians. Delegates came to Jerusalem, where they met with the apostles and elders (pastors) there (verses 2-4). Both sides debated and disputed at great length, with the major views being fully represented (verse 7). Finally, they reached a decision, which everyone agreed to support. They sent letters to the various congregations informing them of this decision (15:23; 16:4).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_72"></a>We should notice that the leaders of the church worked together after the decision despite the sharp differences of opinion that had originally existed. They also worked together in sending letters of recommendation and collecting special offerings (Acts 18:27; II Corinthians 8:19). They loved each other, helped each other, and even rebuked each other when they saw the need. Paul rebuked Peter and others &#8220;when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel&#8221; (Galatians 2:14).</p>
<p class="bodytext">What took place in Acts 15 was a democratic discussion in which a strong majority of the elders formulated a decision under the influence of the Holy Spirit (verse 28). After this conference, the church united in support of the decision. Democracy does not mean doing whatever we choose and never listening to someone else, but it means following the majority on nonessential, nondoctrinal matters. When a majority makes a decision, we should accept the decision with a good attitude, without murmuring, complaining, or sowing discord.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If we have confidence in our leaders and fellow ministers, then it is easy to believe that God can influence a majority of them in the right direction. If we love our fellow believers, we can accede to the wishes of the majority. At the same time, the leaders must not have an attitude of pride that says, &#8220;I am the leader, so you do as I say.&#8221; Ministers are not lords over God&#8217;s heritage but examples to the flock (I Peter 5:3). All of us should manifest brotherly and sisterly love, &#8220;in honour preferring one another&#8221; (Romans 12:10).</p>
<p class="bodytext">What should a business meeting or a conference be like? The participants should not speak with anger, resentment, or bitterness. How can we act in this manner and at the same time inspire others? How can we exercise the ministry of reconciliation if we cannot get along with each other? A conference is a time to conduct business but also a time for fellowship, healing, renewal, and the outpouring of the Holy <a id="page_73"></a>Spirit. It should be a time for strengthening convictions and listening to others proclaim the message that we love. It is refreshing to hear someone else explain the truth in such a way that we can say, &#8220;This is what I believe, too.&#8221; Conferences are times for mutual encouragement, not for talebearing, murmuring, complaining, or disputing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the business of the church, let us guard against a stubborn attitude. It should be a warning if we find ourselves saying, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll just do it anyway&#8221;; &#8220;If they don&#8217;t do it my way, I won&#8217;t participate&#8221;; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t need anyone to tell me what to do.&#8221; Instead, the church should foster unity, respect, and collaboration as we each strive for holiness in all areas of Christian living.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Roles of Men and Women</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">God created male and female and throughout Scripture attention is given to distinction of gender. Yet men and women can and should be able to interact as brothers and sisters in the Lord with peace and unity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Historically societies have struggled with proper interaction as evidenced by the feminist movement in the Western world. Some things about the feminist movement are consistent with the Word of God, but some things are not. On the positive side, the Bible teaches that women and men are equal in importance and value. They are potentially equal in talent, intelligence, and spiritual gifts. There is no unequal treatment of male and female in Christ (Galatians 3:28). Throughout the Bible, God used women as prophetesses, judges, teachers, deaconesses, and laborers in the gospel. (See Judges 4:4; Isaiah 8:3; Acts 18:26; 21:9; Romans 16:1; Philippians 4:3.) Applying these principles to daily life, women and men deserve equal pay for equal performance of the same job.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_74"></a>At the same time, the roles of wife and husband are different, and so are the roles of mother and father. The Bible teaches mutual submission to one another, and it also teaches that the wife should follow the godly leadership of her own husband. (See Ephesians 5:21-22; Colossians 3:18; I Peter 3:1.) God has given the husband the primary responsibility of providing for his family and leading them in righteousness. Along with that responsibility comes the authority to fulfill this role.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The husband is to love his wife as Christ loves the church and to treat her kindly (Ephesians 5:25; Colossians 3:19). He is to honor and respect her; otherwise, his prayers will be hindered (I Peter 3:7).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The ancient Jewish rabbis pointed out that in the Genesis account the woman came from the side of the man, not from his head or his feet. Thus, they explained, she is not to lead him, nor is he to dominate her, but he should cherish her by his side. She is a helper comparable to and suitable for him; husband and wife complement each other (Genesis 2:18). A wife&#8217;s first responsibility is to help her husband and care for her children. The Bible strongly advocates marriage and the home, while condemning extramarital sexual relationships, homosexuality, and lesbianism. (See chapter 11.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Can any man assert authority over any woman? No. A man is the leader of his own home, and a woman should respect the leadership of her own husband. Beyond that, general principles of leadership and authority apply.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the early church, women prayed and prophesied publicly (Acts 2:17; 21:9; I Corinthians 11:5; 14:31). However, they were not to interrupt a public assembly to ask questions&#8212;a privilege that men often had in those days (I Corinthians 14:34-35). In the New Testament, women functioned in leadership and ministry roles (Romans 16:1-12). However, they were not to usurp authority but fulfilled leadership and teaching roles under the authority of men (I Timothy 2:11-12).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_75"></a>In spiritual matters, a woman should follow the leadership of her husband as he follows the Lord. Even if he is not a Christian, she should acknowledge him as the leader of the family in order to win him to God (I Peter 3:1-2). On matters of personal conviction, doctrine, and spiritual experience, a woman must be true to her own individual beliefs since God ultimately will judge everyone on an individual basis.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Holiness As a Way of Life</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">In the final analysis, we can only give suggestions and advice based on prayer, biblical study, and experience. God gives each individual the privilege and responsibility to respond according to his or her own conscience. Of course, we are all responsible to obey the clear teachings of Scripture regardless of personal opinions and desires.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Christian life is a personal relationship with God. It is a continual search for holiness as we draw close to God and become more like Him. If we will let His Spirit lead us and if we will cultivate the fruit of the Spirit, then the pursuit of holiness will not be difficult. It will be a joy and not a burden. It will be the way we want to live.</p>
