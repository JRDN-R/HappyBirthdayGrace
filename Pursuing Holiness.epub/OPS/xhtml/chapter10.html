<h2 class="h2b"><b><a id="page_159"></a><a id="ch21"/><a href="contents.html#ch21">The Temple of God</a></b></h2>
<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you? . . . If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy&#8221; (I Corinthians 6:19; 3:17).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1">In our commitment to worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness (Psalms 96:9), we are careful with how we treat the body God has given us. The body is a temple, or dwelling place, for the Spirit of God. For this reason, we are not to defile the body but are to keep it holy. In the broadest application, we are not to commit sin with our physical bodies, and we are to protect the collective body of Christ, which is the church. In this chapter, we will restrict our discussion to specific activities that harm and defile our physical bodies. We will particularly discuss the application of these principles to food, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and drugs.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Food</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Immediately after the Creation, God gave to humans all vegetables, grains, and fruits for food, with the exception of the tree of knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 1:29; 2:16-17). After the Flood, God explained that humans could eat every living thing, both plants and animals, with the exception of blood (Genesis 9:1-4). In both instances, God retained <a id="page_160"></a>one thing as a symbol of His lordship. While He specified that humans could eat meat, He prohibited them from eating blood because it is a symbol of life and He alone is the giver of life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The law of Moses restricted the diet of Israel in several ways. (See Leviticus 11; Deuteronomy 14.) God allowed the Israelites to eat all animals that both chewed the cud and had a divided hoof (Leviticus 11:3). Animals forbidden by this rule were the camel, coney, hare, and pig. Aquatic animals without scales and fins were also unclean (Leviticus 11:10). Twenty kinds of birds, mostly scavengers and birds of prey, were unclean (Leviticus 11:13-19). All flying, creeping things&#8212;i.e., insects&#8212;were unclean with the exception of the locust, the bald locust, the beetle (or cricket, NKJV and NIV), and the grasshopper.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The main purpose of these dietary laws was to separate Israel from all other nations. They also helped to protect the Israelites from unsanitary and disease-carrying food. In those days, medical information about germs was unknown while sanitation was primitive by modern standards, so these laws promoted health. For example, pork is a well-known source of trichinosis if it is not cooked properly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In Acts 15 the leaders of the New Testament church met to establish which restrictions of the Jewish law apply to Gentiles. The moral teachings were not an issue, because everyone knew that they were the same in every age, but they discussed ceremonial laws such as circumcision. They decided that Gentile Christians did not need to be circumcised but needed to keep four points of the Jewish law:</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>1. Abstain from food offered to idols.</i> We are not to have anything to do with idol worship. We are not to participate in idolatrous festivals or eat food in situations that would give seeming endorsement of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>2. Abstain from fornication.</i> This word covers all types of sexual intercourse outside marriage, including premarital sex, adultery, and homosexuality. (See chapter 11.) This <a id="page_161"></a>statement is probably included here to make sure that the Gentiles would define fornication according to the provisions of the law of Moses instead of by pagan beliefs. For instance, the Gentiles needed to know the definition of incest according to the law of Moses (Leviticus 18:6-18).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>3. Abstain from things strangled.</i> The reference is to Leviticus 17:13-14. When an animal is killed, it must be butchered so that the blood drains out of the carcass. If an animal is merely strangled, the blood remains in it, and anyone who eats the meat would be eating blood, which is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>4. Abstain from blood.</i> As discussed below, we are not to eat blood, because it represents life. This command teaches us that life is sacred, and therefore we should abstain from bloodshed&#8212;the taking of human life.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Acts 15 does not mention any of the Jewish laws concerning unclean animals. Consequently, Christians are free to eat anything except for blood and, in certain situations, food offered to idols. The Old Testament laws concerning food were a shadow of things to come. They signify Christians&#8217; need to distinguish between clean and unclean things in a moral sense and to separate themselves from everything that is spiritually unclean. But Christians are not bound by the specific dietary laws of Moses. &#8220;Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, . . . which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ&#8221; (Colossians 2:16-17).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the last days some teachers will start &#8220;forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth&#8221; (I Timothy 4:3). Such teaching against marriage and against certain types of food is contrary to the will of God. Marriage is sanctified by the Word of God, and all foods are sanctified by thanksgiving and prayer (verses 4-5). There is no New Testament restriction on certain kinds of food.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_162"></a>Temperance and Gluttony</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Christians are to be temperate and moderate in their eating habits. We should practice good eating habits to preserve our health and strength, and we should refrain from foods that affect us adversely.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We should not be guilty of gluttony&#8212;eating to excess. Excessive eating can be sinful (Deuteronomy 21:20; Proverbs 23:21). Proverbs 25:16 teaches us to be temperate and moderate in eating. Jesus warned us not to be &#8220;overcharged with surfeiting,&#8221; which includes eating excessively or to the point of nausea (Luke 21:34). Some people refuse to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes because these substances are harmful to the body, but they literally eat themselves to death. Overeating and improper eating can cause a variety of diseases and eventually a premature death.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This is an abuse of the temple of God. What impression do we make on sinners if we condemn intemperance and overindulgence in some areas while being equally guilty in the area of eating? What kind of image do ministers present if they are grossly overweight from too much eating and too little exercise? We have Christian liberty in the area of food, but we must also follow our common sense and the leading of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We are to be &#8220;temperate in all things&#8221; (I Corinthians 9:25). Temperance means moderation and self-control. It should be our watchword when we consider any physical activity or fleshly emotion. Those who rule their spirit are better than those who conquer a city (Proverbs 16:32). Those who do not rule their spirit are like a city without defenses (Proverbs 25:28). We must keep our bodies under subjection (I Corinthians 9:27). We must not yield our bodies to anything but the Spirit of God (Romans 6:12-13).</p>
<p class="bodytext">For these reasons, we abstain from anything that would cause us to lose control of ourselves or remove us from the <a id="page_163"></a>guidance of the Holy Spirit, either permanently by addiction or temporarily by intoxication. Paul explained the proper exercise of Christian liberty in this matter: &#8220;All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient [beneficial, helpful]: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any&#8221; (I Corinthians 6:12). If we yield ourselves to something, then we become its servant (Romans 6:16). If we allow ourselves to become addicted or intoxicated, then we undermine our defense against sin, and God cannot use us as He wills.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Beverages</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The law was lenient concerning drinks (Deuteronomy 14:26), yet the Old Testament warns against intoxicating drinks (Proverbs 20:1; Isaiah 5:11). The New Testament says that whatever we eat or drink, we should do it for the glory of God (I Corinthians 10:31). In considering what to eat or drink, we should ask, &#8220;Can I eat or drink this to the glory of God?&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Coffee, tea, and most carbonated beverages are mild stimulants because they contain caffeine. Medical research reveals that under normal circumstances caffeine is not harmful. However, if we become nervous, irritable, weak, sick, or unable to fast unless we get our morning cup of coffee or our daily soft drink, then we should carefully evaluate our use. We do not need any habit that controls or dictates to us. If any substance causes harmful side effects or is habit forming, we must learn to control it.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_164"></a>Alcoholic Beverages</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">With the principle of self-control in mind, we must give special attention to alcohol: &#8220;Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise&#8221; (Proverbs 20:1). &#8220;Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright&#8221; (Proverbs 23:31). This statement is a clear warning against drinking wine after it has fermented and has become intoxicating. The evil consequences of drinking wine and mixed wine are woe, sorrow, contention, babbling, wounds, bloodshot eyes, sexual sin, indecent talk, loss of balance and coordination, insensibility, and addiction (Proverbs 23:29-35). Additionally, lovers of wine will not be rich (Proverbs 21:17).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Throughout the Old Testament, all who were separated to God were forbidden to drink wine and strong drink. Nazarites were prohibited from drinking alcoholic beverages (Numbers 6:3; Judges 13:7). John the Baptist did not drink it (Luke 1:15). It was not for kings and princes lest it cause them to forget God&#8217;s law and pervert justice (Proverbs 31:4-5). Priests were forbidden to drink it when they ministered before God in the Tabernacle or Temple (Leviticus 10:9; Ezekiel 44:21).</p>
<p class="bodytext">As Christians, all of us are separated unto God. We are kings and priests, a royal priesthood, and living sacrifices unto God (Revelation 1:6; I Peter 2:9; Romans 12:1). Our special identity indicates that we should not drink alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sin resulted from the first wine drinking recorded in the Bible. When Noah became drunk, he dishonored his own body, causing embarrassment to others and an opportunity for others to sin (Genesis 9:20-25). When Lot became intoxicated, he committed incest with his own daughters (Genesis 19:32-38). God pronounced a woe on drunkenness (Isaiah 5:11). Strong drink caused the people, the priests, and the <a id="page_165"></a>prophets to err, to lose their way, and to lose their spiritual eyesight (Isaiah 28:7). Wine enslaves the heart of people, just as harlotry does (Hosea 4:11). God also pronounced a woe on those who give drink to their neighbors (Habakkuk 2:15).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The New Testament classifies drunkenness as a sin that will keep people from inheriting the kingdom of God (I Corinthians 6:10; Galatians 5:19-21). Jesus, Paul, and Peter all warned against drunkenness (Luke 21:34; Romans 13:13; Ephesians 5:18; I Peter 4:3). Bishops, deacons, and aged women are specifically instructed not to be given to wine (I Timothy 3:3, 8; Titus 1:7; 2:3).</p>
<p class="bodytext">After reviewing the teaching of Scripture, we conclude that Christians should not indulge in alcoholic beverages. Some biblical references seem to support the drinking of wine, however. To study them, we will investigate the Hebrew and Greek words for wine.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Two major Hebrew words are translated &#8220;wine&#8221; in the Old Testament. Nine other Hebrew words for various types of wine and strong drink appear only a few times.<i> Yayin</i> is the most common word. It can mean any type of wine, but it usually refers to fermented wine. Many verses clearly use<i> yayin </i>to mean fermented wine (Genesis 9:21; 19:32; II Samuel 13:28; Esther 1:10; Proverbs 20:1; 23:31; 31:4).<i> Yayin</i> can also refer to freshly made, unfermented grape juice (Isaiah 16:10; Jeremiah 48:33).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The other frequently used Hebrew word for wine is <i>tiyrosh.</i> It almost always refers to newly made, unfermented wine. Only this word is used for the wine that was to be tithed, because God wanted tithes first, before significant fermentation took place (Deuteronomy 12:17; 14:23; Nehemiah 13:5). It is the word used for prosperity in the phrase &#8220;corn and wine&#8221; (Genesis 27:28, 37; Deuteronomy 7:13; etc.). It is translated &#8220;new wine&#8221; in many places (Proverbs 3:10; Joel 1:10; etc.) and as &#8220;sweet wine&#8221; in one place (Micah 6:15). Isaiah 65:8 uses<i> tiyrosh</i> to speak of &#8220;new wine found in the <a id="page_166"></a>cluster.&#8221; Here it clearly refers to unfermented grape juice, even juice still in the grape.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Greek<i> oinos</i> is the original word for wine in the New Testament. It usually refers to fermented wine, but like its Hebrew counterparts it can refer to unfermented wine as well. At least three New Testament verses definitely use it in this way (Matthew 9:17; Mark 2:22; Luke 5:37). These verses say that new, unfermented wine is not placed in old wineskins because when the wine ferments it would burst them. The Greek word<i> gleukos</i> appears only once, where it is translated &#8220;new wine&#8221; (Acts 2:13). It can mean freshly made wine (grape juice), or it can mean sweet wine. The latter could be quite intoxicating, as Acts 2 indicates.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In sum, the word<i> wine</i> in both testaments can refer to fermented or unfermented grape juice. In New Testament days, wine was often served at meals, but in this case it was greatly diluted with water so that it would not be intoxicating in normal quantities. Moreover, methods of preserving grape juice in an unfermented condition were well known. In light of these facts and the biblical warnings against wine, we should not use biblical references for wine to promote the drinking of strong alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p class="bodytext">People in the Old Testament often drank alcoholic beverages, but we see the detrimental results. They did not have the overcoming power that accompanies the indwelling Holy Spirit. The law showed people how sinful they were but did not give them power over sin. If it had been perfect, there would be no need for the new covenant. Today, God gives us grace and power to overcome. We can and must live up to God&#8217;s ideal for the church as a body of separated, holy people.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus turned water into wine at a wedding feast in Cana (John 2:1-11). He thereby performed an act of creation, which indicates that the wine was fresh, not fermented, for fermentation is a process of decay. Verse 10 does not say that the guests got drunk but simply that they had freely drunk the <a id="page_167"></a>other wine provided by the host. In any case, it is not reasonable to suppose that Jesus gave people a strong drink that would enable them to get drunk. Drunkenness is a sin, and God tempts no one to sin (Galatians 5:21; James 1:13).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul advised Timothy, &#8220;Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach&#8217;s sake and thine often infirmities&#8221; (I Timothy 5:23). He recommended that Timothy drink juice instead of water in order to strengthen his body and soothe his weak stomach. Perhaps he was advising Timothy to stay away from the unsanitary local water or to take a small amount of wine for medicinal purposes. He would not have instructed Timothy to drink a strong alcoholic beverage, for that would only aggravate his weakened condition.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Bible does not say that Jesus and the disciples used &#8220;wine&#8221; at the Last Supper, but it simply says &#8220;the fruit of the vine&#8221; (Matthew 26:29; Mark 14:25; Luke 22:18). These words tell us they used juice from the grape without specifying whether it was fermented or not. If it was the typical diluted juice served at meals, then it was not intoxicating. Technically, fresh juice begins to ferment as soon as it is made, unless the process is halted artificially, but in the early stages it is not intoxicating.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Moreover, the same reasons why they used unleavened bread could have led them to use unfermented wine. In this context, leaven symbolizes impurity or sin. Leaven is an agent such as yeast (a type of fungus) that causes the fermentation of bread dough. Chemically, this process is the same type of decay or organic change that causes juice to ferment. The purpose of our discussion is not to prescribe a certain form for the communion service but to show that we cannot use the Last Supper to justify social drinking of alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some Corinthians got drunk at church when partaking of their fellowship meal before the actual communion service (I Corinthians 11:20-22). Each person brought his or her own <a id="page_168"></a>food (verse 21), and some evidently brought fermented wine. This passage does not condone the practice but condemns it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In sum, drunkenness is a work of the flesh that will keep people from inheriting the kingdom of God. In addition, both in the Bible and in our day alcohol is the source of many evils. It causes poverty, sickness, lost time, lost money, heartache, violence, evil thoughts, family breakups, sexual sins, physical injuries, mental injuries, and death.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There is no way to measure the sin that alcohol induces, but we can see its effects every day. Surely, these evils are great enough to demonstrate that the warnings of Proverbs 23:29-35 and 21:17 are true.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The biblical and social arguments for abstention from alcoholic beverages are strong. First, it is practically impossible for people to drink so little that they are never affected mentally or never get drunk. Inevitably, their behavior and actions will be affected to some degree. At that point, they are no longer in complete control of themselves and will often do things they should not do. They are no longer able to fully guard themselves against temptation and sin. They become the servant of alcohol when they yield their bodies to it. Since our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit, we do not want anything else to gain control of them. Likewise, we do not want to use something that is physically dangerous and debilitating. Either way, we would defile our bodies.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Second, not everyone can resist the temptation presented by a drink, and not everyone can handle even a small amount of alcohol. The safest course is not to touch it at all. Even those who think they can safely handle it can easily create a stumbling block for others. This is a sufficient reason in itself for abstention according to Romans 14:21. Children and teenagers, as well adults who have struggled with alcohol, all benefit from a good example and are harmed by a bad example.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Finally, the Bible tells us to avoid all appearance of evil (I Thessalonians 5:22). We need to consider our reputation <a id="page_169"></a>within the church and the reputation of the church in the eyes of the world. To some, abstention may seem extreme, but it is a guaranteed solution to all the problems caused by alcohol. Without the Holy Spirit, abstention may seem difficult or impossible, but the Spirit gives us power to overcome. God makes us a new creation with new loves and desires (II Corinthians 5:17). He takes away the very desire so that we no longer want to drink. The Spirit gives us all the joy, peace, relaxation, and satisfaction that we need (Romans 14:17; Ephesians 5:18). Alcohol may give temporary joy and temporary escape from problems, but the Holy Spirit gives us permanent joy and permanent solutions to our problems.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Drugs and Narcotics</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Our discussion of the evils of alcohol applies to other drugs as well, for alcohol is a type of drug. Marijuana, for example, causes many of the same evils as alcohol. Its use causes lack of self-control, can cause psychological addiction, and can lead to use of hard drugs. The hard drugs are clearly addictive and physically harmful, and are a major cause of crime. Any recreational drug use that causes the equivalent of drunkenness (loss of self-control), leads to sin, causes physical harm, or causes us to become dependent on it (addiction) is contrary to the will of God. We also need to be cautious with legal medications so as to minimize or avoid these dangers. We should practice moderation, self-control, and self-discipline if we use painkillers, sleeping pills, or other medications.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Tobacco</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Tobacco defiles the human body. &#8220;To defile&#8221; means to dirty, make filthy, dishonor, corrupt the purity or perfection <a id="page_170"></a>of, contaminate. For centuries, godly leaders have recognized that smoking is filthy and harmful to the body. The Holy Spirit taught them that it was harmful long before science did.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Bible does not directly refer to tobacco since it was not used in Bible days. It was first used by Native Americans and came to the attention of the world after Europeans discovered America. But the principles of God&#8217;s Word apply to every age, culture, and country, including circumstances that did not exist in New Testament times. When facing new situations, God leads the church by His Spirit and enables the church to make appropriate decisions and applications of biblical principles. (See Matthew 18:18; Acts 15:28.) Thus, the church body and godly leaders have authority to instruct believers with regard to tobacco and drugs, even though the Bible does not specifically mention them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Modern science has determined that tobacco is highly addictive and that smoking is harmful to the body. Consequently, U.S. law currently bans cigarette advertising on television. Every package of cigarettes and every printed advertisement for cigarettes must have a message such as the following: &#8220;Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.&#8221; Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and emphysema. It is also associated with many other types of cancer and respiratory illnesses as well as strokes and heart trouble. &#8220;Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, resulting in approximately 440,000 deaths each year. More than 8.6 million people in the United States have at least one serious illness caused by smoking.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">According to the World Health Organization, smoking is the second major cause of death worldwide. Ten percent of all adult deaths are now caused by tobacco. If current smoking patterns continue, one-half of the people who smoke&#8212;about 650 million people in 2006&#8212;will eventually die because of <a id="page_171"></a>tobacco. Tobacco is responsible for 4.1 percent of worldwide disease.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If health experts around the world agree smoking is detrimental, we as Christians should avoid subjecting our temples to it. In addition, tobacco is highly addictive. Many people try to break the habit but simply cannot without God&#8217;s help. For all these reasons we do not use tobacco in any form.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Because of God&#8217;s extravagant mercies, we have the honor of being a temple in which His Spirit may dwell. To reverence this special relationship, we should respect our bodies and make our temples habitable: &#8220;Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit&#8221; (II Corinthians 7:1). &#8220;Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service&#8221; (Romans 12:1).</p>
