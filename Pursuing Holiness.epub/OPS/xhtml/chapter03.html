<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another&#8221; (Galatians 5:13).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1">Biblical Christianity is not a life of drudgery but a life of liberty. Unfortunately, some people use this concept to justify their rejection of practical holiness teachings. Some discard many important aspects of moral law under this guise. Chapter 2 has shown that rejection of legalism does not nullify moral law, nor does it justify libertinism. This chapter discusses the biblical meaning of liberty in Christ and demonstrates that Christian liberty does not eliminate the need for personal holiness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Freedom from Sin</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">First and foremost, Christian liberty means we are no longer under bondage to sin. Before our conversion we were at the mercy of the sinful nature and could not help but sin. If we seemingly conquered sin in one area, it would reassert its position in another aspect of our lives.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Through the Holy Spirit we now have power over sin&#8212; power not to sin. We can freely choose to sin or not to sin. Of course, as Christians we must choose not to sin. If we abuse <a id="page_48"></a>our liberty and choose to live in sin again, we will surrender our new-found freedom. When a prisoner receives freedom, he has liberty to rejoin society; he is not given the liberty to return to jail each day. Likewise, we receive freedom from sin in order to have fellowship with God, not to return to the slavery of sin. For the first time, we are free to obey God and to become His servants (Romans 6:14-20, 22).</p>
<p class="bodytext">A person will either serve good or evil, God or Satan. He or she will either receive eternal life or death. There is no middle ground in which a person can live his or her own life without choosing either alternative.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Christian liberty cannot mean Christians are free to do as they please without reference to the will of God. By rejecting the will of God, they automatically choose the world, sin, and Satan. To be freed from the will of God automatically means submission to the dominion of sin. To be freed from sin automatically means submission to the will of God. By definition, to exercise Christian liberty means to break free from sin&#8217;s bondage, to obey and serve God, which in turn means to serve &#8220;righteousness unto holiness&#8221; and to bear &#8220;fruit unto holiness.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Freedom from the Law</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Christian liberty also means freedom from the law. As we discussed in Chapter 2 and in the preceding section, Christian liberty cannot mean that moral law has been abolished. Rather, it means that we have been freed from the law of the Old Testament in at least four specific ways: we are free from (1) the penalty of the law, (2) the attempt to fulfill the law by human effort alone, (3) the destructive power of the law that arises from human abuse of it, and (4) the ceremonial law.</p>
<p class="bodytext">First, we are freed from the penalty and condemnation of the law. The law condemned us to death, but when we apply Christ&#8217;s atonement to our lives we are pardoned: &#8220;Christ hath <a id="page_49"></a>redeemed us from the curse of the law&#8221; (Galatians 3:13). The law has no more power to condemn us when we are in Christ.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Second, we are freed from the attempt to fulfill the law through human effort alone. Of course, God never meant for the law to bring righteousness in itself; salvation has never been by works, but always by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9), both before and during the law (Romans 4:1-12). God gave the law to define sin, to prove our utter sinfulness, to prove our need of God&#8217;s grace, and to point us to Christ (Romans 3:20; 5:20; 7:7; Galatians 3:24).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In order to fulfill these purposes, God subjected people to the law, even though they did not have power to fulfill the law. God&#8217;s people were actually under bondage to the law, just as a child is treated like a servant (slave) under tutors (guardians) and governors (administrators) until he or she reaches maturity (Galatians 4:1-11, 21-31).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Godly people in the Old Testament did not have the full power of the Holy Ghost available to them to overcome sin on a daily basis (Romans 8:3-4; Hebrews 8:7-13; I Peter 1:10-12). They were never able to live up to the law because they had to rely on weak, sinful flesh. They were saved by faith expressed in obedience to God&#8217;s plan for that day; they attempted to fulfill the law and offered sacrifices continually to atone for their failures.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The gospel of Christ has delivered us from this bondage to the law. By faith in Christ, we receive the righteousness of Christ without the deeds of the law (Romans 3:28). Through the Holy Spirit, we can fulfill all the righteousness that the law demanded but could not impart. God counts us righteous (justifies us) through faith in Christ and progressively makes us righteous (sanctifies us) as we submit to and cooperate with His indwelling Spirit. Rather than being bound to an externally imposed law, we receive the moral law of God in our hearts as part of the regenerated nature (Romans 7:5-6; 8:1-4; Galatians 3:24-25; 5:18-23).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_50"></a>Third, we are freed from the destructive power of the law caused by human abuse of it. Many Jews at the time of Christ falsely believed they could obtain righteousness merely by the works of the law (Romans 9:31-10:4). This was a gross distortion of God&#8217;s original purpose for giving the law. The law, which was good in itself, actually became a harmful force because they relied on it for salvation and so rejected Christ. Paul attacked this legalistic thinking in his day. Acts 15, Romans, and Galatians refute this doctrine as taught by some Jewish Christians.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Finally, we are specifically freed from the ceremonial law of the Old Testament (Mark 7:15; Galatians 3:24-25; 4:9-11, 21-31). God used the ceremonial law&#8212;including blood sacrifices, dietary laws, circumcision, sabbaths, and feasts&#8212;as types and foreshadowings of truth to be found in Christ and His gospel. Now that we have the substance (antitype) we no longer need the shadow (type). &#8220;When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us at. our sins, having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. . . . Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ&#8221; (Colossians 2:13-14, 16-17, NIV). Thus, the New Testament church refused to impose the Jewish law upon Gentile Christians (Acts 15).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Freedom in Non-Moral Matters</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">True to the principle of freedom from ceremonial law, Christians have liberty of action in non-moral matters. In general, Christians are free to participate in any activity or practice <a id="page_51"></a>that does not violate biblical morality. They have freedom to follow individual judgment, desire, and conscience in areas where the Bible is silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Romans 14 gives guidelines for situations in which consciences differ. This chapter deals with morally indifferent issues, so we must be careful to apply its teachings within that context. The first controversial issue Paul addressed was the eating of meat. This could refer to vegetarianism, eating meat possibly offered to idols, or eating meat classified as unclean under Jewish law. Secondly, Paul discussed the proper observance of certain days, such as sabbaths and other Jewish holy days. Later in the chapter, Paul mentioned the drinking of wine (any juice from the grape). This, too, involved Jewish law, for juice from the grape could be ceremonially unclean (Daniel 1:8-16) or forbidden by a Nazarite vow (Numbers 6:3).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In each of these cases, the New Testament nowhere prohibits the questioned conduct, but in fact expressly forbids anyone to establish rules against it (Acts 15:19-29; Colossians 2:16; I Timothy 4:1-5). This chapter does not deal with morally objectionable practices or practices condemned by the Word of God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">With respect to these morally neutral issues, Paul presented several important guidelines: (1) We must not judge others, but must avoid controversies over these issues. The one who participates should not despise or ridicule the one who abstains. The one who abstains should not condemn the one who participates. (2) Everyone should have convictions and should follow them. If participators have faith in their liberty, they should keep it to themselves; if they have doubts, they should stop. Abstainers should continue to abstain if they have any doubts at all. (3) Whatever we do should be done unto the Lord, that is, with the conviction that we are obeying and glorifying the Lord in everything. In all things we must acknowledge the lordship of Christ. (4) In no case should we <a id="page_52"></a>allow our exercise of Christian liberty to put an obstacle in the path of another. Rather than judging others, we should judge ourselves so that our actions will not cause others to stumble. We should not let our liberty destroy others or the work of God, but in all things we should seek peace and edification.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul also explained the proper use of Christian liberty in his discussion of food offered to idols (I Corinthians 8:1-13; 10:23-33). Since an idol is nothing, there is nothing inherently immoral or dangerous about eating food that someone had offered to an idol. However, if others saw a Christian eating food offered to idols, they probably would interpret it as endorsing or condoning idol worship. For their sakes, therefore, Paul told the Corinthians not to eat food they knew was offered to idols.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What if Christians buy food in the market or eat food at someone else&#8217;s house? There is no need to worry about whether it has previously been offered to idols or not. For the sake of an onlooker&#8217;s conscience, they should innocently eat the food without asking questions. In no case, however, can Christians insist upon liberty if their actions will harm others.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>We Must Always Obey God&#8217;s Word</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Some people abuse the concept of Christian liberty in order to condone violation of holiness principles. In the last days ungodly people will &#8220;change the grace of our God into a license for immorality&#8221; (Jude 4, NIV). False teachers will appeal to lustful desires and promise liberty but will actually be under bondage to sin (II Peter 2:18-19). Some think they can continue to sin because they are no longer under the law but under grace. Their attitude is, &#8220;I can sin because I know God will forgive me.&#8221; Paul rejected this philosophy emphatically: &#8220;God forbid!&#8221; (Romans 6:15).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_53"></a>As Chapter 2 discussed, God&#8217;s moral law is still binding, and Christian liberty means freedom to submit to truth, not freedom from truth. Even though we have liberty, we must not use it to gratify the desires of the flesh. Christian liberty does not give us license to disobey God&#8217;s moral law or the principles of God&#8217;s Word. Paul explained, &#8220;You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love. . . . The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God&#8221; (Galatians 5:13, 19-20, NIV).</p>
<p class="bodytext">God&#8217;s Word also teaches submission to godly authority. Christian liberty does not eliminate our responsibility to follow His church and His leaders when they apply biblical principles of holiness to contemporary issues. &#8220;Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you&#8221; (Hebrews 13:17). The apostles and elders in Jerusalem wrote letters to Gentiles Christians specifying what was required of them: &#8220;For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things&#8221; (Acts 15:28).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some people quote a few passages out of context in order to justify abandonment of all moral restraints. For example, Paul wrote, &#8220;I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean&#8221; (Romans 14:14). The context of this verse makes it clear that Paul was not referring to all activities but to non-moral issues. The immediate context shows that he specifically referred to the eating of certain types of food sometimes considered to be unclean (Romans 14:6, 15, 20). In fact, the NIV translates this clause <a id="page_54"></a>as &#8220;I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself.&#8221; This verse could not mean no activity is immoral in itself, for this would contradict all of Paul&#8217;s practical teaching in chapters 12 and 13. Nor could it mean that all physical things are intended and fit for human consumption. Surely, Paul did not recommend for us to drink hemlock, bathe in poison ivy, smoke opium, or get drunk on alcohol!</p>
<p class="bodytext">In two other verses, Paul stated, &#8220;All things are lawful unto [for] me, but all things are not expedient&#8221; (I Corinthians 6:12; 10:23). Again, the context of each verse indicates that he was dealing with non-moral matters and specifically meant all foods are permissible to eat. First Corinthians 6:13 states, &#8220;Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.&#8221; The passage in I Corinthians 10 deals with the question of eating food offered to idols. Neither passage can be interpreted to mean that all activities are permissible, for I Corinthians 6:9-10 states, &#8220;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Guidelines for Proper Use of Christian Liberty</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Our liberty does not permit us to indulge in fleshly desires, to commit sin, or to violate God&#8217;s Word. We find other important guidelines for the proper exercise of Christian liberty, even with respect to non-moral matters.</p>
<p class="bodytext">(1) All exercise of liberty should be to the glory of God: (I Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:17).</p>
<p class="bodytext">(2) We should avoid anything detrimental to us, whether physically, mentally, or spiritually, even if it is not inherently sinful (I Corinthians 6:12). Many commentators believe Paul <a id="page_55"></a>quoted an expression the Corinthians used to justify questionable conduct and then commented upon it. Thus, the NIV translates, &#8220;&#8216;Everything is permissible for me&#8217;&#8212;but not everything is beneficial.&#8221; I Corinthians 10:23 uses the word<i> edify: </i>&#8220;All things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">(3) We must regulate our activities so that none of them controls us. We must not allow anything to dominate our will or rob us of too much energy, time, and money or interfere with our relationship with God. (I Corinthians 6:12).</p>
<p class="bodytext">(4) The Christian must never exercise liberty in a way that would harm others. (Romans 14:15-16, 20, NIV).</p>
<p class="bodytext">It is possible for something to be morally neutral in itself and yet violate one of these principles. Some things may be detrimental to one person and not to another, because of differences of personality, background, or experience before conversion. A certain situation may pose a great temptation for one person but not for another.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We must be careful to follow our own convictions even though others do not share them. Something could be wrong for one person even if not wrong for another person. If we violate a conviction solely because of pressure from others, we violate the faith principle in our life and may place ourselves in a damaging situation from which God is trying to protect us. We should not ridicule others&#8217; convictions because we may destroy a defense mechanism God has erected for them. At the same time, we should not try to impose our convictions on someone who may not need them as much as we do. Of course, this discussion applies only to situations not specifically covered by scriptural teachings.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Tolerance but Not Compromise</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The concept of Christian liberty teaches us to be tolerant of the different personal convictions and preferences of fellow <a id="page_56"></a>Christians. In no case can we compromise with sin. We must avoid the one extreme of legalism and the other extreme of condoning ungodly and immoral practices. A mature understanding of Christian liberty will show us that certain things are not sinful but yet are detrimental to us spiritually. Therefore, we can personally avoid them and even point out their dangers without necessarily condemning those who do not understand the dangers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The legalist who does not understand Christian liberty is forced to pigeonhole everything in one of two categories: either a practice is sinful and will send one to Hell or it is not sinful and therefore perfectly permissible. However, it is scriptural to recognize that some things are not necessarily sinful in themselves but yet are not beneficial to Christian living.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some things can be a &#8220;weight&#8221; or hindrance and yet not be sin (Hebrews 12:1). In such cases, a proper exercise of Christian liberty would cause us to avoid them. Yet, if some do not agree totally on this issue, we can still accept their status as a Christian. In this way, we can warn of the dangers of certain practices without being legalistic. This allows us to have fellowship with other believers without having to agree 100 percent on every personal conviction.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Legalism, Liberty, and Church Standards</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">How does our discussion of legalism and liberty affect the establishment of specific church standards for conduct? Certainly, the church must continue to teach against practices the Bible opposes. To do this effectively, ministers cannot merely parrot certain phrases but must explain the Bible&#8217;s teachings and apply them to contemporary situations. The church must define clearly what it means to lie, to defraud, to dress immodestly, and so on. The writers of the epistles gave <a id="page_57"></a>some very specific instructions with respect to situations in their day, and the church must do likewise today.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In some cases, the Bible presents a general principle but does not give detailed instructions for our culture. For example, it teaches men to have short hair but does not specify the precise length. It teaches women to dress modestly but does not describe a dress length. In such cases the church should reach a consensus as to the implementation of these principles. It must send forth a clear sound, presenting clear guidance to the believer and a clear witness to the unbeliever.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The church should not be chaotic but orderly, and its members should walk orderly and in unity (II Thessalonians 3:6-7). (See I Corinthians 14:8, 10 for an analogous situation.) If everyone did what was right in his or her own eyes without submitting to leadership, the result would be chaos and confusion (Judges 21:25). Some differences of opinion will exist, but since one Spirit has baptized us into one body we should be able to reach a reasonable position that all can uphold before the world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This position should not be what we regard as the absolute minimum, but rather a moderate stance. It should be conservative, for we must live within biblically acceptable limits. (Only a legalist would insist on an absolute minimum. Others would rather be &#8220;extra&#8221; close to God rather than risk being too close to the world.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Honest-hearted converts truly desire to know how to apply scriptural principles. They want practical direction from experienced, mature, spiritual leaders. A wise person appreciates counsel, instruction, correction, and reproof (Proverbs 11:14; 13:1; 17:10). True children of God seek godly leaders who will warn of danger and protect their souls (Hebrews 13:17). They will not despise or reject authority (II Peter 2:10; Jude 8), for God has established authority and government in the church to give specific guidance (I Corinthians 12:28; I Thessalonians 5:12-13; I Timothy 5:17; II Timothy 4:2).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_58"></a>Even in areas where we have Christian liberty, if the four principles we have discussed lead to one conclusion, then the church should teach that conclusion. Even though eating meat offered to idols fell within the scope of Christian liberty, Paul taught against it in all situations where it could be a stumbling block. Similarly, the council at Jerusalem did not hesitate to forbid this practice and to announce their decision as binding upon the whole church (Acts 15:28-29).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The church can uphold biblical standards of holiness and not be legalistic or violate Christian liberty. Standards can become legalistic, however, if we present them in the manner described in Chapter 2.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Legalism, Liberty, and Teaching</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">In particular, when we try to apply biblical principles to modern situations, we must be careful not to claim the same authority for our particular application that exists for the principle itself. If we maintain that every conceivable deviation from our particular application is a sin, we can fall into legalism.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For example, we believe quite strongly that it is not God&#8217;s will for us to drink alcoholic beverages. Yet can we say the actual taste of alcohol is sinful? If so, it would be a sin to go to a restaurant and eat cherries jubilee or meat cooked in a wine sauce. It would be sinful to use vanilla extract. Those who use fermented wine at communion would be committing sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We also believe that most television programming is not conducive to godly living and that watching some movies can be sinful. Yet can we say the machine itself is evil or the act of watching the news is necessarily a sin? If so, glancing at a TV in a store display would be sinful. Watching a presidential address or a cultural event would be a sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_59"></a>The purpose of these examples is not to undermine solid holiness teaching, but to demonstrate the proper approach to holiness teaching. We do not have to take such arbitrary positions in order to maintain holy living. If we use a legalistic approach in teaching against certain practices, our rules will either be inconsistent or ridiculously harsh. We will alienate sincere, thinking people with unwarranted extremism. On the other hand, we can use a mature understanding of Christian liberty to approach holiness in a positive way. This approach will be moderate, temperate, and rational without surrendering important practical teachings. In fact, it will enhance those teachings and facilitate their acceptance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For example, by properly applying Christian liberty we can teach that Christians should not drink alcoholic beverages. It violates scriptural guidelines for the proper exercise of Christian liberty: (1) It fails to give God glory in any way, but in fact it could bring a reproach. (2) It is physically, mentally, and spiritually damaging. (3) It has strong potential for getting mastery over us. (4) It is a stumbling block to others, particularly to members of our own family.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">John Calvin defined Christian liberty as consisting of three things. First, we renounce the righteousness that comes by observing law and look solely to Christ for righteousness. Second, the conscience is freed from the yoke of the law and voluntarily obeys the will of God. Third, we have the free use of morally indifferent things. Calvin observed that Christian liberty is &#8220;perversely interpreted by some who use it as a cloak for their lust, and they may licentiously abuse the good gifts of God.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">In summary, the Christian life is characterized by liberty. Through the gospel of Jesus Christ we receive freedom from <a id="page_60"></a>sin, freedom from the law, and freedom to act as we will in non-moral matters. We follow &#8220;the law of liberty,&#8221; which means freedom to do God&#8217;s will and to obey His Word (James 1:25; 2:12).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In no case does Christian liberty give us license to commit sin, violate God&#8217;s Word, or gratify the lusts of the flesh. Furthermore, our exercise of Christian liberty must always be regulated by four questions: (1) Can I glorify God in this activity? (2) Is this activity detrimental physically, mentally, or spiritually? (3) Can this activity gain mastery over me and bring me under its control? (4) Is this activity a stumbling block to another believer or to an unbeliever? These guidelines even extend to things morally neutral or innocent in themselves.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If the Bible condemns a practice either specifically or in principle, then we must obey. If the four basic guidelines for exercise of Christian liberty point to a certain course of action, then again we obey. If an issue is morally neutral and the four guidelines do not define a certain response, we apply the teaching of Romans 14. We must grant liberty to others and not treat our private convictions as gospel. We must not impose our tradition, preferences, or habits upon others and condemn them as sinners if they do not conform. The participator should not despise the abstainer and the abstainer should not condemn the participator, but everyone should avoid contention, seek peace, and seek to edify. No one should judge another in the matter, but each must be true to his or her own convictions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When we implement the concept of Christian liberty, we will find that it does not detract from but rather it enhances holiness teaching. It is the biblical alternative to legalism. A mature understanding of our liberty in Christ will motivate us to live a holy life worthy of the freedom given to us. Christian liberty will lead to a life of greater holiness, because it enables us for the first time to submit voluntarily to the will of God. Liberated from the bondage of sin and the law, we freely choose to obey the Word of God.</p>
