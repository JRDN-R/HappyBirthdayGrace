<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_77"></a><i>&#8220;Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ&#8217;s sake hath forgiven you&#8221; (Ephesians 4:31-32).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1">Cultivating a holy attitude is an important part of the Christian life. In fact attitudes are the most important elements of holiness. If we have the proper attitude toward God and our fellow humans, we will manifest holiness in all areas of life. If we do not have the right attitude, no amount of outward holiness will compensate for the lack of inward holiness in the sight of God. Wrong attitudes are the first signs of backsliding and are inevitable components of hypocrisy.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Love</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Once again, we emphasize that love is the basic attitude that distinguishes true Christians from the world. We can sum up all the law and prophets in two commandments: Love God and love our fellow humans (Matthew 22:36-40; Mark 12:28-31; Luke 10:27). Love will cause us to keep God&#8217;s commandments (John 14:15, 23). In fact, we demonstrate our love for God by how faithfully we obey His Word (I John 2:3-5).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_78"></a>Jesus commanded that we love one another even as He has loved us (John 15:12, 17). Love one to another is the ultimate test of true Christianity (John 13:34-35). If we do not love our brothers and sisters, then we do not love God (I John 4:20-21). Love is the fulfillment of the law (Leviticus 19:18; Romans 13:10; James 2:8). God calls Christians to extend love to every human being, even enemies (Matthew 5:43-48). Once again, this type of love is the ultimate proof of Christianity, for even sinners love those who love them in return (Matthew 5:46).</p>
<p class="bodytext">We cannot overemphasize the necessity of love as the basis for all actions and all relationships. Love never fails (I Corinthians 13:8). We will not fail God or each other if we let love have its perfect work. No activity or attribute is worth anything if love is not the underlying force and motivating factor (I Corinthians 13:1-3; Revelation 2:1-5). The preceding passages list the following things that are valueless without love: speaking in tongues, eloquence, prophecy, wisdom, knowledge, faith, sacrifice, philanthropy, works, labor, patience, right doctrine, right leadership, right fellowship, perseverance, and zeal for Jesus&#8217; name.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Let us apply these teachings about love to the subject of holiness. First, we should love God enough to do His perfect will. If we love Him as we should, we will want to be like Him as much as possible. We will try to avoid anything that is not like Him. We will want to please Him even in areas that from a human viewpoint might seem to be unnecessary or trivial. If we begin to question holiness teachings, we should check to see how deep our love for God really is.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Second, we should be on guard when any type of resentment or dislike arises in us toward another human being. We must retain a loving and forgiving attitude toward that person if we want to maintain our holiness and our Christianity. Love for others means we are patient, kind, not envious, not egotistical, not boastful, mannerly, not self-seeking, not easily provoked, <a id="page_79"></a>slow to think evil of someone, and pleased only with what is good. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things (I Corinthians 13:4-7). Our actions must be motivated by this kind of love for God and our fellow humans. Following holiness teachings for any other reason or without this love is worthless and will lead to hypocrisy.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Attitudes to Avoid</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Having established the importance of right attitudes, let us examine some specific teachings concerning them. Ephesians 4:31, quoted at the beginning of this chapter, lists some dangerous attitudes that Christians must put away. If we allow these attitudes to remain in our lives, we will feed the flesh and starve our spiritual life.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Bitterness</i></b> is something sharp, disagreeable, distasteful, harsh, severe, resentful, or vehement. This type of attitude produces piercing remarks and unpleasant language. It is never appropriate. Some people think they can put aside their spirituality and give vent to their bitterness, but they cannot do so if they want to be holy. Even when leaders issue necessary rebukes, they must not do so with personal bitterness or with sharp, disagreeable, harsh, severe words. There is a time for rebuke and exhortation but never with bitterness.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Wrath</i></b> is violent anger, rage, or indignation; the word suggests a desire to avenge or punish. The flesh wants to get revenge, and it often does so by a display of harsh feelings or a cutting remark. We may disagree on certain issues, but we must not become resentful or vengeful. We may be perfectly correct in principle, but if we allow ourselves to become violently angry or wrathful then we are wrong. The same is true about the other wrong attitudes we are discussing. We cannot allow ourselves to be ungoverned, but we must learn to control <a id="page_80"></a>our feelings. Instead of relying upon our own strength, we control wrath through prayer and seeking God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It is especially disgraceful for a minister to become violently angry or resentful, even with regard to the work of the church. There is no way to explain this lack of control to followers. We must remember that &#8220;the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God&#8221; (James 1:20).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Anger</i></b> is a feeling of extreme displeasure that usually results from injury or opposition. The word itself does not suggest a definite degree of intensity, nor does it necessarily require an outward manifestation. If anger is allowed to go uncontrolled, it usually manifests itself as a desire to lash out at someone or something. If controlled and used properly, anger may be constructive and even beneficial. For example, Jesus displayed anger against sin when He cleansed the Temple of thieves. Thus, anger itself is not sinful, but in many situations it can easily lead to sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What kind of anger is permissible and what is not? &#8220;Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath&#8221; (Ephesians 4:26). Anger that causes us to harm someone in word or deed is wrong. Anger that we carry in our heart and nurse into a grudge is also wrong. Anger without a cause is wrong (Matthew 5:22).</p>
<p class="bodytext">If there is a just cause for anger, we should not take the situation personally and we should not direct that anger against an individual to hurt him or her. Instead, we should use the emotional force as a motivation to correct the wrong if possible. Then, we should forgive the other individual involved and pray until the situation no longer has power over us. Regardless of the circumstances, temperance or self-control is part of the fruit of the Spirit that we should display (Galatians 5:23).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Clamor</i></b> is noisy shouting, outcry, uproar, or insistent demand. Some people constantly complain. They clamor to get their way. Some adults throw temper tantrums and <a id="page_81"></a>act as stubborn as small children who fall on the floor, scream, and kick. People who keep the church in an uproar&#8212;constantly demanding attention, always presenting demands, or blocking the progress of the church&#8212; are guilty of clamor. Scripture condemns this attitude and behavior.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Evil speaking</i></b> comes from an evil heart. Much of it stems from jealousy. Do we allow ourselves to speak evil of people? Do we cause trouble by our speech? (See chapter 6 for further discussion of talebearing and reviling.)</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Malice</i></b> is active ill will, a desire to hurt others. Malice takes pleasure in causing someone to suffer or in seeing someone suffer. It is usually the result of hatred, which is like the sin of murder in the eyes of God (I John 3:15). We should hate sin but not the sinner. We can rejoice when sin is defeated but never in the misfortunes and sufferings of other people, even if they are sinners. Love does not rejoice in iniquity but only in the truth (I Corinthians 13:6).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Envy and jealousy</i></b> are closely associated with bitterness, wrath, malice, and strife. Envy is resentment or ill will because of the advantages, possessions, or accomplishments of someone else. Jealousy is a resentful suspicion or rivalry. These attitudes often involve spite or greed.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Envy and strife are capable of producing any and every kind of evil (James 3:16). Envy is a work of the flesh that prevents people from going to Heaven (Galatians 5:21; James 4:5). This spirit surfaces unexpectedly in places where it should not be. People may get upset when someone else is used more in the church, is recognized more than they, receives certain favors, or even receives spiritual blessings.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_82"></a>Forgiveness</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">In place of all evil attitudes, Scripture exhorts us to be kind to one another, tenderhearted, and forgiving. Forgiveness is based on love and involves bearing the cost of someone else&#8217;s mistake. It means giving up our rights in certain situations and ignoring certain things even when we know we are correct. It means swallowing our pride and asking others to forgive us even when we think they should be asking our pardon instead. It means turning the other cheek (Matthew 5:39).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Most importantly, forgiveness includes a decision to forget. Some people say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll forgive, but I won&#8217;t forget.&#8221; They need to pray until they<i> can</i> forget; that is, until they no longer hold anything against someone. Some people pretend to forget but bring up an old grudge at a future confrontation. Or they may bring up an old mistake in order to gain some advantage over someone. This is not true forgiveness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Forgiveness does not mean saying someone is right when they have done evil or saying their actions do not matter. Nor does it mean making ourselves vulnerable to those who have harmed us, thereby enabling them to harm us again. But it does mean refusing to retaliate with evil and refusing to harbor bitterness. It means putting the past behind us and being willing to accept sincere repentance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus plainly taught that God will forgive us only as much as we forgive others (Matthew 6:12, 14-15; 18:23-35). If we want to be forgiven of our sins, we must learn to forgive our brothers and sisters when they make mistakes.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>A Root of Bitterness</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Some people seemingly can never be satisfied. They murmur, complain, refuse to cooperate, and are self-willed. They cannot accept correction without becoming angry. They are <a id="page_83"></a>busybodies, they sow discord in the church, they are talebearers, and they cause problems everywhere they go. What is wrong? It could be that they have a root of bitterness. &#8220;Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled&#8221; (Hebrews 12:15).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Significantly, this statement comes immediately after the admonition to follow peace and holiness (verse 14). In other words, bitterness will defile our holiness. The implication is that having a proper attitude is the most important aspect of holiness.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A root of bitterness is a source of bitterness. It is something in the heart that causes the outward manifestations we have identified. From this root many types of fruit come forth, none of which is the fruit of the Spirit. The actual root could be a grudge, jealousy, a wrong done to us that we have not turned over to God, or something else in our heart that we have never surrendered to God. If we develop a bad attitude, we should check for a source of bitterness in our heart. We must cut it out and destroy it so that we can bear enjoyable fruit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We do not have the authority to judge the motives or heart of others, but we can observe fruit. If we see an apple growing on a tree, we know that it is an apple tree. The fruit speaks for itself. Likewise, when someone has a root of bitterness, the fruit will be easy to observe. Without attempting to judge the person, we can know enough to avoid participating in the gossip, envy, hatred, and strife that come out of that source. We can refuse to partake of such fruit, lest we be one of the many who are defiled by that person&#8217;s root of bitterness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_84"></a>Nothing Shall Offend</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The Christian&#8217;s attitude stands in stark contrast to the root of bitterness and all of its resulting attitudes. &#8220;Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them&#8221; (Psalm 119:165). Peace is the result of loving God and His Word (Philippians 4:7). Peace is one of the results of being justified (counted as righteous in the sight of God) (Romans 5:1).</p>
<p class="bodytext">An offense is something that causes a person to stumble in his or her walk with God. God&#8217;s Word teaches us not to let anything offend us (cause us to stumble) and not to offend others (cause others to stumble). (See Matthew 5:29-30; 13:41; James 3:2.) Nothing will be a stumbling block to those who love the Word of God.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We sometimes hear complaints such as the following: &#8220;They invited others, but they did not invite me.&#8221; &#8220;They asked others to do something at church but not me.&#8221; &#8220;They never ask me to participate.&#8221; &#8220;I was entitled to a certain thing because of my position or age, but they did not give it to me.&#8221; &#8220;They did not speak to me.&#8221; How many times have our feelings been hurt because we were rebuked, misunderstood, or overlooked? In all these cases, let us remember: &#8220;Nothing shall offend.&#8221; Perhaps there were good reasons for a certain action that we do not know about, perhaps we did not get the true story, or perhaps someone made a mistake.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Regardless of the circumstances, we cannot allow ourselves to develop a bad attitude or lose our faith in God and in the church. We need an attitude of forgiveness when it appears that others have mistreated us&#8212;even if they do not ask forgiveness. When we pray the Lord&#8217;s Prayer, we ask God to forgive us as much as we forgive others! (See Matthew 6:12-15.) Even when there is a violation of custom or etiquette, and even if we are in the right, we cannot allow ourselves to develop a bitter, unforgiving spirit. If we love God, <a id="page_85"></a>then we will not let anything become a stumbling block to us. No matter what happens, we will not stumble and fall.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It may seem humanly impossible to respond positively to negative situations, but God gives us the power to overcome. Instead of complaining, &#8220;I am offended,&#8221; or &#8220;Someone hurt my feelings,&#8221; let us pray until God gives us victory in every situation.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Attitude When Corrected</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">We must maintain this determination in times of rebuke or reproof. &#8220;Shew me thy ways, O L<span class="smallcaps">ORD;</span> teach me thy paths&#8221; (Psalm 25:4). Some people think they never need instruction, correction, rebuke, reproof, or exhortation. But the Word of God says we do. God has placed government in the church, and everyone from the highest in position to the lowest is subject to godly authority. Even Peter and Paul accepted rebuke from others (Galatians 2:11-14; Acts 23:3-5). People who do not wish to submit to spiritual authority are on their way to apostasy (II Peter 2:10).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Let us never esteem ourselves so highly that we cannot accept admonition, rebuke, or exhortation. When someone in spiritual authority admonishes us out of love and faithfulness, we should carefully consider the admonition with the attitude of &#8220;Thank you for trying to help me&#8221;&#8212;not &#8220;I&#8217;m just as spiritual as you are, and you have made mistakes too, so I don&#8217;t need to listen to you.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Hebrews 13:17 says, &#8220;Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.&#8221; This admonition applies to all believers, including leaders, and it teaches some important principles. First, God has ordained leaders in the church. He has organized a system of church government. <a id="page_86"></a>Second, we are to be humble and obedient. &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice. . . . For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft&#8221; (I Samuel 15:22-23). Third, true leaders have a duty to watch over our souls. If they see something sinful or dangerous, they have an obligation to warn us. We should accept their warning without becoming angry, for they are merely fulfilling their duty. Fourth, leaders are responsible to God. Whether they warn us or not is between them and God. Whether we listen and submit is between us and God. Finally, God will be our judge, and all rebellion against His authority will be unprofitable for us.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If we are wise, we will accept reproof (Proverbs 17:10). Just a few words of admonition are sufficient if we have the proper attitude. If we think we are beyond reproof, then we place ourselves in the position of a scoffer or a wicked person. If we are wise, we will love the godly leader or friend who rebukes us. (See Proverbs 9:7-9.) Both those giving a rebuke and receiving a rebuke must have the proper attitude in order for there to be good results.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Can a leader be rebuked? Nothing in Scripture suggests that a minister or other leader is exempt from these guidelines. Of course, the rebuke must come from someone with the proper spiritual authority. Even elders (pastors) who live in sin should be rebuked before others, so that everyone may learn (I Timothy 5:20). Unfortunately, when some are rebuked they receive so much sympathy and comfort from &#8220;friends&#8221; that they do not repent but instead become rebellious. In this case, no one learns what God intended.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Preachers are authorized, and indeed commanded, to use the Word to reprove (correct or convince), rebuke, and exhort (encourage) (II Timothy 3:16; 4:2). Consequently, let us always have the proper attitude when we receive admonition. Let us pray, &#8220;Show me your ways, Lord. Lead me. When I stray, send someone or something to correct me before it is too late. Help me to have a good attitude when I listen to <a id="page_87"></a>messages or even to personal admonition. Help me not to make excuses, justify myself, or rebel against godly authority, but teach me to obey. Give me leaders who love me enough to teach me the truth and correct me when I need it.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Murmuring and Complaining</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">According to Jude 15-16, those who murmur (grumble) and complain (find fault) are ungodly. When differences arise, Christians are to pray for one another and encourage one another, not attack one another (Philippians 2:14). If there is a problem between two people, they should seek reconciliation without spreading the problem to others, and if necessary they can go to church leaders (Matthew 18:15-18). Instead, if they complain and murmur by talking or writing, they can become guilty of sowing discord.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It does not take much to tempt the average person or congregation to complain. Small inconveniences or the temporary lack of water, food, clothing, or money will test everyone. If we do not allow God to guide us, we easily become prisoners of our desires, appetites, and passions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Israelites, for example, began to complain about everything in the second month of their journey through the wilderness (Exodus 16:1-3). In Exodus alone we find twelve major complaints of Israel against God&#8217;s plan and God&#8217;s chosen leader. Their complaining stemmed from unbelief and a lack of respect for God&#8217;s appointed leadership. Because of their unbelief they ended up traveling for forty years on a journey that should have taken only a few months.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jude 11 teaches us to avoid the rebellion of Korah. This man criticized Moses and challenged his spiritual authority. Consequently, God caused the earth to swallow him and his followers. When Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses, the Lord heard it (Numbers 12:2). Although Miriam and Aaron were <a id="page_88"></a>the older siblings of Moses, God rebuked them just the same. &#8220;Were ye not afraid to speak against my servant?&#8221; God asked (Numbers 12:8). Miriam was stricken with leprosy for seven days as punishment for her sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul learned &#8220;in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content&#8221; (Philippians 4:11). When we feel mistreated, the solution is not to murmur and complain. Rather, we will find our answer through prayer. If applicable and necessary, we should talk directly to the person who has created the unpleasant situation. But we should not seek to avenge ourselves, for that prerogative belongs to God alone (Romans 12:19).</p>
<p class="bodytext">We find an excellent example of the proper attitude in David&#8217;s relationship to Saul. Saul clearly wronged David, even trying to take his life. Saul had sinned to the point where God rejected him, and Samuel had already anointed David to be the next king. Yet, on two occasions, David refused to kill Saul when he had the chance to do so. As long as Saul was king, David did not want to harm him. David waited for God to remove Saul.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Instead of grumbling and finding fault, let us learn to be content, to pray, and to talk about situations to the right people with the right attitude. There is no use in confronting a matter if we cannot speak with a humble, quiet, forgiving spirit.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Complaining is contagious. It is also contrary to the Word of the Lord.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Proper Relationships with Fellow Believers</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">In addition to having a proper relationship with leaders, we need a proper relationship with fellow believers. Busybodies are inquisitive about other people&#8217;s personal affairs, meddlers in the business of others, people who are busy with matters that should not concern them. I Peter 4:15 tells us not to suffer &#8220;as <a id="page_89"></a>a busybody in other men&#8217;s matters.&#8221; Paul also warned against busybodies (II Thessalonians 3:11; I Timothy 5:13). According to Proverbs 20:3, a meddler is a fool.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Busybodies seem to know a little about everyone else&#8217;s business and involve themselves in all kinds of problems. Often they try to interfere with the disciplining of an individual and try to &#8220;solve problems&#8221; without working with the pastor. Most of the time they do not help, but they just add more wood to the fire. Such people are a curse to a neighborhood and a plague to a church. These people try to find out everything that is going on. They feel that they are important and that they know everything. Actually they cannot be trusted with any important job that requires keeping things in confidence. As a result, a busybody does not qualify for the ministry.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We should examine ourselves to see if we have the tendency to be a busybody. If we are inquisitive by nature, we must let the Holy Spirit deliver us from excessive curiosity concerning other people&#8217;s lives. In respecting others&#8217; lives we maintain proper relationships with our brothers and sisters.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Humility</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The Bible maks it clear that a humble spirit is a prerequisite for healthy Christian living. God hates a proud look (Proverbs 6:17). He resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). Pride was the sin that caused Satan to fall, and it will cause the downfall and destruction of all who harbor it (Isaiah 14:12-15; Proverbs 16:18). The pride of life is one of the three basic categories of worldliness that tempt Christians (I John 2:16). John the Baptist and Jesus preached their harshest sermons against the hypocrisy and pride of religious people. Remarkably, they did not direct these vehement statements at the acknowledged sinners but at the spiritual <a id="page_90"></a>leaders of their day. Clearly, religious people are susceptible to the sin of pride.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When talking about holiness, it is easy to become self-righteous and critical of others. It is possible to look holy but to be full of pride and hypocrisy, and in such a case we will not be justified in the sight of God. As an example, God rejected the pious prayer of a self-righteous Pharisee but heard the sincere cry of repentance from a sinful tax collector (Luke 18:9-14).</p>
<p class="bodytext">We must not let pride enter our hearts because we know truth and follow after holiness. Nor can we allow ourselves to develop the appearance of pride.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Preachers are susceptible in both areas. Since God hates a proud look, we should be careful how we conduct ourselves. Do we manifest pride in the way we speak to believers, in the way we sit on the platform, or even in the way we walk around with our Bibles?</p>
<p class="bodytext">No matter how spiritually mature we may be, we must always guard against pride. The more successful we are spiritually, the more the devil would like to tempt us with pride. We must seek after humility.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Even in this pursuit we must be careful, for some people try so hard to display humility that they actually appear to take pride in their so-called humility. True humility neither exalts nor disparages self but is not preoccupied with self. If we think we are very humble, then most likely we are not. If we rejoice in the attainment of great humility, then probably we have just lost it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We can eradicate pride through prayer&#8212;the kind of prayer in which we fall down on our faces before God, lie prostrate before Him, and weep in His presence. We examine our hearts, and we ask God to reveal to us our true motives and attitudes. As we confess our faults, failures, inadequacies, and sins, we recognize the depth of our unworthiness and the magnitude of God&#8217;s mercy and grace. This kind of prayer is <a id="page_91"></a>not counted in minutes but in hours. After our spirit is broken and pride is washed away, then we can receive precious blessings and anointing from God. Such an experience is not something to boast of to others but to hide in our hearts. By periodically renewing this type of experience, we can guard against pride.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>The Most Important Aspect of Holiness</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">In conclusion, a proper attitude is the most important aspect of holiness. A person with a humble, teachable attitude and a genuine desire to live for God can always be led to greater truth. Inward holiness will lead to outward holiness, but the reverse is not true. We often forget this, because it is easy to observe and compare outward holiness but more difficult to discern inward holiness. Outward holiness is often the easiest part to obey, while attitudes and spirits are more difficult to control.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A wrong attitude can be just as sinful as an act that we commit. Let us check our hearts for pride, murmuring, sowing discord, bitterness, wrath, and other evil attitudes. It would be sad to live in outward conformity to scriptural teachings yet destroy our life of holiness through an evil attitude that we allow to creep into our heart.</p>
