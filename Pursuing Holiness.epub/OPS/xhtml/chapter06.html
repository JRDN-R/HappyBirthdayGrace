<h2 class="h2b"><a href="contents.html#ch13"><b>The Tongue:</b><br/><b>An Unruly Member</b></a></h2>
<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison&#8221; (James 3:8).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;Let the words of my mouth . . . be acceptable in thy sight, O L<span class="smallcaps">ORD&#8221;</span> (Psalm 19:14).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1">The tongue is the most difficult member of the body to control, and it has the potential for causing the most harm. The way we use the tongue is a good indication of our relationship with God. The tongue speaks whatever is in the heart. If we speak evil, then evil must be in our heart, &#8220;for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh&#8221; (Matthew 12:34).</p>
<p class="bodytext">James contains strong teaching concerning the tongue. &#8220;If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man&#8217;s religion is vain&#8221; (James 1:26). &#8220;If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body&#8221; (James 3:2). The tongue is like a bit in a horse&#8217;s mouth that controls the movements of the horse, a small helm that controls a large ship, and a small fire that can cause great trouble. The tongue can defile the whole body. Only the power of God can tame it (James 3:1-13).</p>
<p class="bodytext">The power of the tongue is apparently one reason why God has chosen speaking in tongues as the initial evidence <a id="page_96"></a>of the Spirit baptism (Acts 2:4; 10:46; 19:6). We receive the Holy Spirit when we repent, believe, and surrender completely to God. Our tongue is the hardest member to tame, so it is the last part of us to yield to God. When we speak in tongues for the first time under the inspiration of the Spirit, it signifies that God has at last come inside and taken complete control.</p>
<p class="bodytext">James makes it clear that it is easy for us to sin with the tongue, that the tongue is dangerous, and that sinning with the tongue can destroy our holiness. Let us discuss some ways in which people sin with the tongue. Let us keep in mind that if it is wrong to speak some things, then it is wrong to listen to some things. Therefore, as we guard our tongue from evil, we should also guard our ear from evil, such as indulging in conversations or radio programs that are contrary to Christian values.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Talebearing or Gossip</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Talebearing is a vicious sin. It is Satan&#8217;s primary tool for destroying the church from within. It can destroy confidence in people, harm the innocent, and hinder the repentant. It splits churches, discourages saints, and disillusions new converts. The Bible teaches us to speak evil of no one, especially our brothers and sisters in the Lord (Titus 3:2; James 4:11; Psalm 101:5).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Most people will readily acknowledge the evils of talebearing, but the problem comes in identifying it in their own lives. It means telling things of a personal, intimate, or sensational nature that are harmful to someone. It involves damaging rumors and backbiting. Talebearing includes lying about someone or spreading negative rumors about someone, but it also includes telling facts of a personal, hurtful nature that the gossiper has no business revealing. Telling a fact can be <a id="page_97"></a>talebearing when it is told as gossip to someone who does not need to know about it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">God has ordained organization and authority in the church (I Corinthians 12:28). When problems arise in the church, those in authority should be informed. Leaders can and must judge situations in order to protect the flock (Matthew 18:18; I Corinthians 6:5).</p>
<p class="bodytext">However, needless disclosure to other members of the congregation is not right. Individuals are not to judge one another (Romans 14:10, 13; Matthew 7:1; James 4:12). Sometimes, information must be shared for clarification, instruction, or accuracy. In general, however, telling stories that could be harmful to others is not right in the sight of God (Proverbs 26:20, 22). How many churches would have peace if their members really believed the teachings of Scripture!</p>
<p class="bodytext">As a practical example, what should we do if we discover that a certain man in the church has committed adultery? We should not conceal the sin, for we do not have that authority. We should report the problem to someone in authority, such as the pastor, presbyter, or superintendent, depending on the person involved. At that point, the matter becomes the leader&#8217;s responsibility. The reason is so the leader can help the sinning brother and also protect others in the church who may be affected by the sin. If we cover up the sin, we could cause great damage to individuals, families, and the whole body.</p>
<p class="bodytext">There is no reason to tell others about the sin, however. If we tell everyone else in the church we become a talebearer. If the brother has repented, why tell others about the sin? How will it help him if we tell everyone else of his fall? The problem is a private matter to be handled by the person, those in authority over him, and the Lord (Proverbs 11:13; 17:9).</p>
<p class="bodytext">As another example, suppose a person falls into sin, repents, and moves to another church. The former pastor should inform the new pastor so the latter may help the person, <a id="page_98"></a>but it is generally not appropriate or necessary to tell the other church members about the problem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We do not have the authority to cover up unrepented sin, regardless of whether a friend is involved or not. Nor should we cover up sin that would scripturally disqualify a person from holding a position. In both cases, the person in authority needs to know. At the same time, we do not need to tell a friend&#8217;s sin to others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A private sin becomes a church problem when the person does not repent but lives as a hypocrite or when the person brings disgrace and reproach upon the church. This point is especially relevant when someone in a position of leadership has sinned. For example, what if a deacon in the church commits adultery but repents? The pastor should be informed because it is a matter that could disgrace the whole church and because the deacon has lost the necessary qualifications, namely, a good report. The one with whom the deacon has sinned as well as anyone else who finds out about the sin will lose confidence in the church if nothing is done. This does not mean that the pastor should make a public announcement of the repented sin. The pastor can relieve the person of spiritual responsibilities without any explanation except that it was by mutual agreement.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In other situations, the pastor may put people on probation or silence them for a period of time. Of course, people should not speculate or gossip about what has happened. It may be best for wrongdoers simply to explain that they need to take some time for personal refreshing, renewing, and refocusing. Sometimes this is beneficial even when no sin has been committed, so the congregation should expect such occurrences without undue suspicion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">What should we do if we hear that someone has said or done something against us? First, since love thinks no evil, we should not be quick to believe the rumor. Instead, we should give the person the benefit of doubt and assume that the story <a id="page_99"></a>is erroneous or that there is a good explanation. Then we should forget about the report.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Second, if the report still bothers us, we should pray for the Lord to give us peace. If the matter cannot be dismissed easily, then we should pray for the Lord to resolve the problem.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Third, if the problem persists even after prayer, we should go to the person who is involved, get the story straight from him or her, and clear up the problem (Matthew 18:15).</p>
<p class="bodytext">What should we do if we hear about serious wrongdoing on the part of someone else? We should take the first two steps just mentioned of not being quick to believe the rumor and praying about the situation. If the situation cannot be ignored, then we should report the matter to those in authority&#8212;typically, the pastor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It then becomes the pastor&#8217;s responsibility to deal with the situation. The pastor can speak to the individual as needed. If the pastor is convinced that the rumor is false, then he or she should advise those who heard it. If there is significant reason to believe that the story is true, then the pastor has a duty to deal with the situation. Either way, we should not pass along the story to other people.</p>
<p class="bodytext">If those in authority hear about a serious problem, they should go to the person who is allegedly involved and seek to clear up the matter. If leaders ask us to explain a matter involving us, we should not become offended, because they are simply fulfilling their responsibility. They are giving us an opportunity to clear up a misunderstanding, and we need to keep a good spirit in this situation. There is no need to find out who started the rumor or who told the leaders, because this could easily lead to vengeance and malice. It is the leaders&#8217; job to clear up the matter and, in the case of a false report, to rebuke or correct those who perpetuated the story. If we are indeed innocent, we should appreciate it when someone reports the situation to the pastor instead of repeating it to others.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_100"></a>Sowing Discord</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The subject of talebearing is important because it is a principal means of sowing discord among believers. Sowing discord is one of seven abominations in Proverbs 6:16-19. An abomination is something God hates, and those who commit abominations will not go to Heaven (Revelation 21:8).</p>
<p class="bodytext">To sow discord means to cause dislike, distrust, and division, and it often occurs by talebearing or constant criticism. Those who sow discord think they can tell anything anywhere, anytime, to anyone. They repeat information they heard in confidence and obtained through friendship. They are not afraid to criticize anyone.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We need to examine ourselves in this area. Do we enjoy gossiping about people? Do we spread negative or injurious information about others instead of talking to them directly about our concerns? Do we enjoy hearing something bad about someone? Do we enjoy telling everything we know? Do we enjoy criticizing or laying blame on others? Do we stir up trouble, dissension, and strife? If any of these things is true, we need to change our ways. It does not matter how well we can preach or sing, if we sow discord we are in trouble with God.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Swearing</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The term swearing has multiple meanings and is specifically mentioned in Scripture: &#8220;But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath . . . lest ye fall into condemnation&#8221; (James 5:12). Jesus said, &#8220;Swear not at all&#8221; (Matthew 5:34).</p>
<p class="bodytext">In the context of this lesson &#8220;swearing&#8221; means to assert something as true or promise something while under oath. An oath is a formal calling of God as a witness. The Bible teaches that we should not swear to anything or bind ourselves by an <a id="page_101"></a>oath to do a certain thing or to join a certain group. Jesus explained that the law of Moses allowed people to swear by the Lord, but He instructed that under the new covenant we should not swear by anything&#8212;not by Heaven (i.e., God), earth, or even by our own heads. The reason is that we do not have the power to change any of these things, to enforce our oaths, or to guarantee our promises. (See Matthew 5:33-37.) God can swear by Himself because He has the power to make whatever He says come to pass. If something did not exist before, it becomes true the minute He speaks it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When we are called upon by law to swear to something, we can simply say, &#8220;I affirm.&#8221; To affirm means to state positively, to confirm, or to assert as valid. As human beings we do not have the power to swear by oath, but we can affirm that what we are saying is true. As Christians our word should always be true, and our promise should be just as good as any oath. We should have only one standard of truth. We do not need to use the words &#8220;I swear&#8221; to prove that at least we are telling the truth this one time, for people should always be able to depend on our word. We do not swear because we cannot control the things we would swear upon, but we can make sure that we always tell the truth and that we perform our promises to the best of our ability.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Taking God&#8217;s Name in Vain</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The commandments applicable today can be grouped into two categories: loving God and loving our neighbor (Mark 12:28-31). The commandment in Exodus 20:7 pertains to loving God by teaching us the proper use of His name: &#8220;Thou shalt not take the name of the L<span class="smallcaps">ORD</span> thy God in vain.&#8221; It prohibits all profane, meaningless, trivial, or irreverent use of God&#8217;s name. It also covers any abuse of His name in false oaths, false religions, and witchcraft. The right way to use <a id="page_102"></a>God&#8217;s name is in praise, worship, preaching, teaching, prayer, and meditation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Jews were so careful about taking the name of the Lord in vain that they developed the custom of never pronouncing the name Jehovah or Yahweh. When reading aloud from the Hebrew Scriptures they would substitute the word <i>Adonai,</i> meaning Lord, for the sacred name Yahweh. When quoting or writing their Scriptures in Greek, they would use the Greek word<i> kurios,</i> which also means Lord. The writers of the New Testament followed this practice and so did the King James translators. For example, Isaiah 40:3 uses the Hebrew word Yahweh, which the translators represented by &#8220;L<span class="smallcaps">ORD&#8221; </span>(large and small capital letters). When Matthew quoted this verse in Greek, he used<i> kurios</i> (Matthew 3:3).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Unfortunately, many Christians treat God&#8217;s name and titles casually. Often they will use the words<i> God, Lord, Jesus,</i> or <i>hallelujah</i> (which means &#8220;praise the Lord&#8221; in Hebrew) in a useless or lighthearted way. For many, it becomes a habit to use one of these words as a mere byword when they are happy, angry, sad, disappointed, or surprised. But we should only use these words when we are sincerely invoking God&#8217;s help, communicating with Him, or talking about Him. If we use these words casually and thoughtlessly, then we diminish their value to inspire faith when we invoke them in prayer and praise. When we reserve these words for sincere, meaningful communication, then we show proper respect for God and preserve their value to inspire faith in the hearts of both speakers and hearers.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Slang</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">We should also be cautious when using slang expressions. Many slang words have negative connotations, and we <a id="page_103"></a>can easily pick up a slang expression without realizing what it really means. What about watered down versions of curse words? If we do not want to use certain words, why use their derivatives and substitutes?</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Filthy Communication</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The Scripture establishes guidelines for a Christian&#8217;s communication: &#8220;Put off . . . filthy communication out of your mouth&#8221; (Colossians 3:8). &#8220;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth&#8221; (Ephesians 4:29). We are the temple of the Holy Spirit, and as such we must not allow dirty jokes, words, and actions to come from us. Words that suggest something indecent should not come from the lips of a Christian. Should praises and vile words come out of the same mouth? &#8220;Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh&#8221; (James 3:11-12).</p>
<p class="bodytext">We are to have &#8220;neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting&#8221; (Ephesians 5:4). This passage does not forbid entertainment, joking, or humor, but it tells us that holiness guidelines apply even in these activities. &#8220;Foolish talking&#8221; means idle, stupid talk. Jesting refers to coarse, obscene talk. In other words, Christians should not take part in smutty, insinuating, sexually oriented stories, jokes, or actions. It is a shame even to talk about some things that are done in secret (Ephesians 5:12). Some things may be appropriate to discuss in a proper setting but not in public or in mixed company. Some things should be kept in confidence between husband and wife. To do less is to profane the sacredness of marital intimacy.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_104"></a>Cursing</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Another Christian principle for communication is to refrain from cursing: &#8220;Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not&#8221; (Romans 12:14). &#8220;Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be&#8221; (James 3:10). These verses deal with the practice of pronouncing a curse upon someone. The Christian attitude is not to return evil for evil but to overcome evil with good (Romans 12:21). Jesus commanded, &#8220;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you&#8221; (Matthew 5:44).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some ministers misunderstand their authority and abuse their position by pronouncing curses upon people. In one case, a woman and her family did something the pastor did not like. In retaliation, he verbally pronounced a curse upon her. As we have just seen, this practice is contrary to the Word of God. All genuine exercise of spiritual gifts must take place with love and for edification. (See I Corinthians 13:1-3; 14:3.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">Sometimes, people cite biblical examples to justify cursing. Let us examine the three primary examples they use: II Kings 2:23-24; Acts 5:3-10; and Acts 13:10-11.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In II Kings 2, a group of young men from the city of Bethel mocked the prophet Elisha. They called him a &#8220;bald head,&#8221; an epithet of contempt and derision in the Old Testament that meant &#8220;worthless fellow.&#8221; They taunted him, &#8220;Go up,&#8221; that is, &#8220;Be translated as you say your master, Elijah, was.&#8221; Elisha rebuked them in the name of the Lord. Later two bears came out and tore forty-two of them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This incident occurred under the old covenant, not in the context of New Testament ministry. We should also note that these men were already under divine condemnation. They were from Bethel, one of the two cities in the northern kingdom of Israel that had erected golden calves to worship <a id="page_105"></a>(I Kings 12:29), and they were mocking the prophet of God and the power of God. Under the law, these men were already condemned to die because of their idolatry (Deuteronomy 13:12-15). God had already cursed them, and the question was simply when the judgment would be carried out. Because God does not always execute judgment speedily, people are prone to think that God has overlooked their sin (Ecclesiastes 8:11). In this case, God delayed His judgment until they began mocking His prophet. Elisha did not place them under a curse but pronounced that the time of God&#8217;s judgment had come.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Acts 5 relates the story of Ananias and Sapphira. This couple tried to deceive the church by making a covenant to lie. God gave Peter a word of knowledge and revealed the truth to him. Peter did not personally curse Ananias and Sapphira but simply told Ananias that he was lying, whereupon God struck him dead. A short time later, God gave Peter another word of knowledge, and he prophesied that Sapphira would die just as her husband had.</p>
<p class="bodytext">When the law was first given, Aaron&#8217;s disobedient sons suffered the penalty of death as an example to everyone of the importance of keeping God&#8217;s Word (Leviticus 10:1-2). Similarly, Ananias and Sapphira died for their hypocrisy at the beginning of the New Testament church. Although hypocrites in the church do not generally die immediately, this example serves as a warning under the new covenant. In neither case did humans curse the offenders, however.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The last case concerns Paul and the sorcerer Barjesus, who opposed the preaching of the gospel in Cyprus. In this case, God gave Paul a word of knowledge as to what He was going to do, and Paul revealed it to Barjesus through prophecy. Paul said, &#8220;The hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind&#8221; (Acts 13:11). Paul did not exhibit hatred or revenge, but this incident confirmed the truth of his message.</p>
<p class="bodytext">These examples do not give us the authority to curse other people, but they demonstrate the judgment of God upon <a id="page_106"></a>sin. To curse someone would be in direct opposition to the Word of God. When people do something wrong, our attitude should be one of mercy and forgiveness. We should pray in love, &#8220;God, have mercy on them. Help them to understand their mistake, and lead them to repentance.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Reviling</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">To revile or to rail means to abuse using words; to use harsh, insolent, or abusive language. Since we are the temple of the Holy Spirit, we should not follow fleshly emotions but respond according to the Spirit. Even if we have been mistreated or misjudged, we should not revile other people (I Corinthians 6:10; 5:11). In I Corinthians 4:12-13 we find the proper reaction when others revile us. The apostles were reviled, persecuted, defamed, and made as the filth of the world. Their response was to bless.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Paul was rebuked for reviling the high priest while under questioning by the Sanhedrin council (Acts 23:1-5). Ananias, the priest, had commanded someone to slap Paul, which was contrary to the law. At the same time he was trying to judge Paul by the law. Paul quickly told Ananias that he was a &#8220;whited wall,&#8221; or hypocrite, for doing this. When Paul said that, those standing by rebuked him for reviling God&#8217;s high priest. When Paul realized that Ananias was the high priest, he apologized. He quoted Exodus 22:28, which prohibits the reviling of a ruler, and explained that he did not know he was speaking to the high priest when he said what he did. Either Paul did not know to whom he was speaking or he did not acknowledge the man&#8217;s usurpation of office. In fact, according to history, Ananias usurped this office from which he had previously been expelled by the Romans for crimes. Paul recognized that even though he was being unjustly condemned, he should not revile the high priest, because of his office.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_107"></a>Even Michael the archangel did not bring a railing or reviling accusation against the devil when contending with him but simply said, &#8220;The Lord rebuke thee&#8221; (Jude 9). Michael did not abuse even Satan with words, remembering no doubt that Satan originally had been created as an anointed cherub. Jude contrasted Michael&#8217;s good attitude with that of apostates who despise authority, speak evil of dignitaries, and speak evil of things they do not know (verses 8, 10).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Peter similarly described apostates, those who have forsaken truth to the point that they do not fear the Word of God. &#8220;But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord&#8221; (II Peter 2:10-11). These people do not want anyone to tell them what to do. They will not accept correction. They are not afraid to speak evil about those in authority over them. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10), but they have no fear or reverence for the Lord, His Word, His church, or His appointed leaders.</p>
<p class="bodytext">According to Peter and Jude, these people need to learn from the angels. The angels who have the responsibility to report to God about these same apostates do not rashly accuse or bitterly condemn them. They merely report the facts as they are without reviling or railing. They are courteous in their reports, even though they have more power than human beings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Thus, we find that the apostles, including Paul, and the angels, including Michael, knew better than to revile. Yet many people do not hesitate to speak harshly to and about fellow believers, including leaders. Sometimes, believers speak disparagingly of their pastors, and ministers speak disparagingly about other ministers. Even if someone has sinned, however, there is a process by which to bring the matter before the <a id="page_108"></a>proper authority. To report facts to those in authority is right, but to speak maliciously and to revile when reporting is wrong.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus warned us to be careful of calling anyone a fool (Matthew 5:22). In the biblical context, this word connotes someone who is morally obstinate, not merely ignorant or simple. (See Psalm 14:1.) Thus, it represents strong condemnation and could become a means of reviling others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness teaches us not to speak evil about anyone and not to revile anyone. Even if people have sunk to the depths of sin, we should not revile them. We should be especially careful not to revile leaders. Those who revile are doing something that the apostles and the angels refused to do, even with regard to the worst sinners and the devil himself.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Lying and Bearing False Witness</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">&#8220;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor&#8221; (Exodus 20:16; Mark 10:19). &#8220;All liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone&#8221; (Revelation 21:8). Scripture shows us that God hates lies (Exodus 20:16; Mark 10:19; Revelation 21:8). Nothing that makes a lie, whether by speech or action, will enter into the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:27). Two of the seven abominations (things God hates) in Proverbs 6:16-19 are a lying tongue and a false witness that speaks lies. Moreover, God wants us to keep our promises even if they hurt us (Psalm 15:4). In short, &#8220;he that speaketh lies shall not escape&#8221; (Proverbs 19:5).</p>
<p class="bodytext">To lie means to make a statement knowing that it is false or to say something with the intent to deceive. It can also involve deliberately giving a false impression to someone who has a right and expectation to know the full truth. In certain situations, it can even be dishonest to tell part of the truth&#8212; for example, if the effect is to conceal additional truth that is necessary to understand a situation correctly from someone <a id="page_109"></a>who has a right to know. For this reason, we are to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in a court of law.</p>
<p class="bodytext">A lie is a lie even if told for a good purpose. The end does not justify the means. For instance, suppose two people have an argument and refuse to speak to each other. A third person decides to be a mediator and falsely tells each person that the other has already apologized. Even though the purpose is to bring reconciliation, the third person has told a lie.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suppose a teenager has parents who will not let him attend church. Should he lie about where he is going in order to attend? No, he should not commit sin in order to go to church. Suppose a woman is married to an unbelieving husband, and he forbids her to pay tithes on his income. She promises not to do so, but should she secretly give this money to the church anyway? No, she has given her word, and she would be lying if she broke it. She would defraud her husband and destroy his confidence in her.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some cite the story of Rahab to demonstrate that the end justifies the means, because she lied to the people of Jericho in order to conceal Israelite spies. However, she was a Gentile who did not know the law of God. She heard about the great things Jehovah had done for Israel, and she believed in Him. As a result, she hid the spies and assisted them in their mission. She was not saved by lying but by her faith as demonstrated by works. God wanted to show His power through Israel so that all nations would see it, believe on Him, and be saved. Rahab was one person who obeyed this plan. If she had known God&#8217;s law and had prayed accordingly, God could have made another way to deliver the spies. Moreover, this example involves concealment in order to save human life, and thus it would not justify lying in lesser circumstances.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Abraham lied on two occasions by saying that his wife, Sarah, was only his sister (Genesis 12:10-20; 20:1-16). He did this because he feared that foreign kings would kill him in <a id="page_110"></a>order to marry Sarah, who was very beautiful. Sarah actually was Abraham&#8217;s half sister, but he was dishonest in not telling these potential suitors that she was also his wife. Both times his deception almost led to disaster, since the kings tried to take Sarah as their wife, thinking she was available. Only the intervention of God restored her to Abraham. Abraham was reproved for his deception both times and was even expelled from the land one time. These incidents show that lying is wrong even when the purpose is to protect our legitimate interests, that lying causes more problems than it solves, that God can deliver us from difficult situations without our resorting to lies, and that telling a half-truth in order to create a false impression can be a lie.</p>
<p class="bodytext">On the other hand, we are not necessarily obligated to disclose everything we know about a situation, especially to someone who does not have a right to know this private information. In order to protect Samuel from the potential wrath of King Saul when Samuel went to anoint David as the future king of Israel, God told him to go to Bethlehem to offer a sacrifice. If someone were to inquire about his trip, he could honestly say that he was offering a sacrifice; he would not need to volunteer that he was also on a secret mission to anoint David. (See I Samuel 16:1-5.)</p>
<p class="bodytext">It is possible to &#8220;make a lie&#8221; by actions as well as words. What if a minister displays a false graduation diploma as if he had earned it? He is lying by giving a false impression. What if an office worker submits a receipt for reimbursement but actually the expense was less than the receipt shows? She has lied and committed fraud. Similarly, what if a worker requisitions money for one thing but spends it on something else? He has lied, unless he obtains authorization for the change. What if he does not spend the full amount of the requisition but pockets the difference? He has lied and committed fraud.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As Christians we do not have to lie. If we have not done anything wrong, we can trust God to help us and protect us in <a id="page_111"></a>difficult situations. From an eternal perspective the old saying is true: Honesty is the best policy.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Careless Words</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Jesus said, &#8220;Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. . . . Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned&#8221; (Matthew 12:34, 36-37). If we speak carelessly, we could easily commit sin and could easily harm others. Therefore, we should think before we speak. What we talk about reveals what is in our heart, and what is in our heart determines whether we are living by faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Importance of the Tongue</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">These words of Jesus demonstrate how important our speech is. As we noted at the beginning of this chapter, James 1:26 warns, &#8220;If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man&#8217;s religion is vain.&#8221; On the other hand, &#8220;if any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body&#8221; (James 3:2). In short, we need to have &#8220;sound speech, that cannot be condemned&#8221; (Titus 2:8). &#8220;Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man&#8221; (Colossians 4:6).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ultimately, only God can help us control our tongues, so we must pray for His guidance and grace in this matter. &#8220;Let the words of my mouth . . . be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord&#8221; (Psalm 19:14). &#8220;Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips&#8221; (Psalm 141:3).</p>
