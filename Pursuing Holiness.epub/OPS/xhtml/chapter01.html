<p class="bodytext"><i>&#8220;Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord&#8221; (Hebrews 12:14).</i></p>
<p class="bodytext1">The Bible calls followers of Christ to a life of holiness and teaches its necessity. &#8220;Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord&#8221; (Hebrews 12:14, NKJV). The work of salvation begins with regeneration, or the new birth; continues with sanctification, a process of progressively becoming more like Christ in this life; and concludes with glorification, or resurrection with an immortal body and sinless perfection. Just as we must be born again to see the kingdom of God, so we must pursue holiness, or sanctification, in order to see the Lord. Holiness is not an option: it is a command to be implemented in all aspects of our lives. &#8220;As He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, because it is written, &#8216;Be holy, for I am holy&#8217;&#8221; (I Peter 1:15-16, NKJV). We obey this command in order to please God, for we belong to Him; to communicate Christ to others; and to benefit ourselves, both now and for eternity.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The new birth is the initial experience of salvation, but the work of salvation does not end there. God calls the Christian to a continued life of holiness. It is imperative for the born-again believer to experience the continuing work of sanctification, which comes by daily submission to the leadership and control of the Holy Spirit. Just as we must be born <a id="page_12"></a>again to see the kingdom of God (John 3:3-5), so must we follow holiness or sanctification in order to see the Lord. The new birth will have no eternal value unless the born-again person continues to walk by faith and live after the new nature of the Spirit, allowing God to complete the work of salvation that began at the new birth.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This chapter presents in condensed form the basic principles of holiness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Definition of Holiness</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">God is holy; holiness is an essential attribute of His nature. With respect to Him, it means absolute purity, and moral perfection. With respect to humankind, holiness means conformity to the character and will of God. We must be holy because God is holy (I Peter 1:15-16). It means thinking as God thinks, loving what He loves, hating what He hates, and acting as Christ would act.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Specifically, holiness consists of two components: (1) <i>separation</i> from sin and the world&#8217;s values and (2)<i> dedication</i> to God and His will. &#8220;Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing: and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God&#8221; (II Corinthians 6:17-7:1). &#8220;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God&#8221; (Romans 12:1-2). The truth of Christ is &#8220;that ye put off, concerning your former <a id="page_13"></a>conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in righteousness and true holiness&#8221; (Ephesians 4:22-24, NKJV).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness means to be like Christ. Instead of gratifying sinful desires, we put on Christ, letting Him be formed in us and adopting His mind (Romans 13:14; Galatians 4:19; Philippians 2:5). We judge decisions and actions by asking, What would Jesus do?</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness also means we cannot love this ungodly world system, identify with it, become attached to the things in it, or participate in its sinful pleasures and activities. &#8220;Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God&#8221; (James 4:4). &#8220;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world&#8221; (I John 2:15-16). One important aspect of pure and undefiled religion is for a person to keep unspotted from the world (James 1:27).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness involves both the inner person and the outer person (I Corinthians 6:19-20; I Thessalonians 5:23). We must perfect holiness by cleansing ourselves of filthiness both of the flesh and of the spirit (II Corinthians 7:1). For example, lustful thoughts are as sinful as an act of adultery (Matthew 5:27-28), and hatred is just as sinful as murder (I John 3:15). Holiness, then, includes attitudes, thoughts, and spiritual stewardship on the one hand and actions, appearance, and physical stewardship on the other. One without the other is insufficient. Inward holiness will produce outward holiness, but the outward appearance of holiness is worthless without inward holiness. For example, a modest spirit will produce <a id="page_14"></a>modest dress, but modest dress is of little value if it conceals a lustful heart.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness comes by faith, love, and walking after the Spirit. First, as with all aspects of salvation, we receive sanctification by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9). Holiness is not a means of earning salvation but a result of salvation. We cannot manufacture our own holiness; we are partakers of God&#8217;s holiness (Hebrews 12:10). Genuine faith results in obedience (Romans 1:5; 16:26; James 2:14-26). Thus, if we truly believe God, we will believe and obey His Word, which in turn will lead to the pursuit of holiness. If we deliberately and persistently disobey God&#8217;s Word, then we are no longer walking in faith.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Second, if we truly love God, we will obey God&#8217;s commandments (John 14:15, 23). Without love, all attempts to live for God are vain (I Corinthians 13:1-13). When we truly love God, we will actively hate evil (Psalm 97:10), and we will seek to become like our holy God. Love is stricter and more demanding than law, for love always goes further than duty. Love for God will cause us to draw closer to God than law will, both in attitudes and in disciplined living. Love will cause us to avoid everything that displeases God or hinders a closer walk with Him. Love rejects anything incompatible with godliness or not conducive to spiritual life, even though no law specifically labels it as sin. In this way, the principle of love leads to greater holiness than does the law of Moses or any other codification of rules. Love dominates all actions and all relationships.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Third, through the Spirit&#8217;s guidance and power, we can overcome sin and live righteously (Romans 8:2-4; Galatians 5:16). We have freedom from sin&#8217;s dominion&#8212;the power to choose not to sin (John 8:34-36; Romans 6:1-25). We will not continue to live in sin; indeed, when we act according to our new identity we cannot sin (I John 3:9). We still have the ability to sin and we still struggle with the inward nature of sin <a id="page_15"></a>(Galatians 5:16-17; I John 1:8; 2:1), but as long as we let the Holy Spirit lead us we will not sin.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness is not an external law but an integral part of our new identity. The Spirit places God&#8217;s moral law within us, not written on stone tablets but in our hearts (Hebrews 10:16). We do not merely follow an external list of rules, but we follow the Holy Spirit within us. We pursue holiness because that is who we are and want to be. We abstain from sin and worldliness because it is anathema to our new nature. We still struggle against the desires of the old nature, but it is an internal struggle. Nobody imposes rules on us; we restrict our flesh because we wish to follow the Spirit. We understand the beauty of holiness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Following Holiness Requires Personal Effort</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness does not come automatically as we rest passively. Some teach that any attempt to live holy is &#8220;of the flesh,&#8221; but they fail to understand that genuine faith always includes obedience and always produces good works. We must open our lives to the working of God&#8217;s Spirit. We must actively implement the spiritual principles He places in us. We must resist the devil, subdue the sinful nature, discipline the flesh, and kill the deeds of the body.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Thus, the Bible teaches, &#8220;Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God&#8221; (Romans 6:11-13). &#8220;Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you&#8221; (James 4:7-8). &#8220;Make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him&#8221; (II Peter 3:14, NIV). Paul said, <a id="page_16"></a>&#8220;I run . . . I fight . . . I discipline my body and bring it into subjection&#8221; (I Corinthians, 9:26-27, NKJV). The Bible exhorts, &#8220;Let us cleanse ourselves. . . . Let us labour. . . . Let us lay aside every weight and . . . sin . . . let us run with patience&#8221; (II Corinthians 7:1; Hebrews 4:11; 12:1).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Philippians 2:12-13 sums it up well. &#8220;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.&#8221; God gives believers both the desire and the power to live righteously. It is our responsibility to reverently and watchfully implement holiness in our lives, and this takes great personal effort and exertion. At the same time, God is actually the One working in us, and He provides both the desire and the power to live righteously. God&#8217;s grace works<i> in</i> us, but we must work it<i> out.</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">We wait for God to liberate us from struggles and temptations, when God expects us to use the power we already have in the Spirit and force the flesh to obey His Word. It is like the man who received a compliment on his garden: &#8220;You and God have really made this piece of land beautiful and productive!&#8221; The gardener replied, &#8220;You should have seen it when God had it by Himself.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>A Daily Walk</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">If we live one day at a time, holiness becomes a possibility rather than an impossibility. We have the power of the Spirit and the promise that God will not allow us to be tempted beyond our capacity to bear it (I Corinthians 10:13). Therefore, unlike an unsaved person, we can say, &#8220;Regardless of the circumstances that will face me, I can live today without sinning.&#8221; If we do sin that day, we can obtain forgiveness and begin the day anew. Jesus encouraged this type of thinking, for He told those whom He delivered, &#8220;Go, and sin no more&#8221; (John 5:14; 8:11). He also gave absolute perfection as the <a id="page_17"></a>goal for which to strive: &#8220;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect&#8221; (Matthew 5:48).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>A Continual Growth Process</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The life of holiness is one of continual growth toward perfection or maturity (Matthew 5:48; II Corinthians 7:1; Philippians 3:12-16). Even though no one is absolutely perfect or holy as God is, we can all be perfect (mature) and holy in a relative sense (II Corinthians 7:1; Philippians 3:15; Colossians 1:28; 4:12). God will consider us holy if we live a repented life, have faith in Christ, live according to the knowledge of His Word, and strive to become progressively more Christ-like (Ephesians 4:13). He expects us to grow continually in grace and knowledge (Mark 4:26-29; II Peter 3:18), and to bear more and more spiritual fruit (John 15:1-8). If we do not become progressively more holy and Christ-like in thought, attitude, conduct, and lifestyle, something is wrong.</p>
<p class="bodytext">God evaluates us individually on the basis of where we have come from, what He has given us, and what our ability is (Matthew 13:23; 25:14-30). Two Christians can both be perfect in God&#8217;s sight even though they have attained different levels of perfection in an absolute sense, just as two children at two different stages of growth can both be perfectly normal and healthy. We must not judge one another or compare one with another, but must be patient and tolerant of different levels of perfection, endeavoring to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace (Matthew 7:1-5; II Corinthians 10:12; Ephesians 4:1-3).</p>
<p class="bodytext">None of us has yet attained the fullness of perfection. Paul wrote, &#8220;Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me. Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting <a id="page_18"></a>those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore let us, as many as are mature, have this mind; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you. Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind&#8221; (Philippians 3:12-16, NKJV).</p>
<p class="bodytext">We must be tolerant of different levels of maturity with respect to practical holiness even while we are careful to maintain the level which we have attained. We must let God be the judge of others. In particular, we should take great care not to condemn, intimidate, or offend visitors and new converts. Due to diversity of backgrounds, some people require more time than others to develop certain holiness convictions. It is better for new converts to develop solid scriptural convictions over a period of time than for them to conform immediately to every detail without understanding why.</p>
<p class="bodytext">God expects increasing production of spiritual fruit (John 15:1-8). Our goal is not to conform to the expectations of others but to follow the leading of God through His Word, Spirit, and church.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Three Teachers of Holiness</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">God has given three teachers of holiness. First, all holiness teachings come from the Bible, the inspired Word of God. Second, the Holy Spirit teaches us by internal promptings and convictions. Third, anointed preachers and teachers proclaim and apply the Word. God has given pastors for the oversight, care, and equipping of the church.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some teachings are explicitly stated in Scripture. Others are practical applications of scriptural principles for our culture, time, and place. There may be some differences of <a id="page_19"></a>opinion on exactly how to apply a principle or where to draw a line. Nevertheless, it is important for pastors to make practical applications, or else the principles will be neglected. Likewise, for our spiritual protection, for the unity of the body, and for a clear witness to the community, it is important for us to follow the teaching and admonition of godly pastors.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Self-Discipline</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">In particular, temperance is an important principle to implement in every aspect of daily living (I Corinthians 9:24-27). This means self-discipline, self-control, and moderation in all things. In the introduction to his book<i> The Disciplined Life, </i>Richard Taylor wrote, &#8220;Christians in a land of bulging supermarkets must discipline their appetites lest they fatten their bodies and stupefy their souls by habitual gourmandizing. They must beware the subtle, insidious tendency to judge the importance of themselves and others by the flashiness of their cars and the cut of their clothes. They must cease from careless spending and showy extravagance, not on the grounds of being unable to afford it, but on the grounds of principle. The alarming tide of moral casualties of recent years in both pulpit and pew is without question the result of that inner softness born of undisciplined, self-indulgent living.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Overcoming Sin: A Practical Approach</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">In the final analysis, holiness means to obey God&#8217;s Word and to resist temptation to sin. As a practical matter, how is it possible to overcome sin on a daily basis?</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>First, we must pray.</i> Prayer will draw us closer to God. Through prayer we commune with Christ and progressively absorb more of His mind and attitude. Paul <a id="page_20"></a>prayed on many occasions that believers would develop spiritual strength and holiness of life (Ephesians 3:16; I Thessalonians 5:23). If prayers of another can avail to develop holiness in us, how much more can our own prayers do so!</p>
<p class="bodytext">In particular, it is important to pray in the Spirit. This means to reach a dimension of prayer in which the mind concentrates totally upon God and the human spirit unites with the Holy Spirit. This includes, but is not limited to, speaking in tongues (I Corinthians 14:14-15). When we pray in the Spirit, the Spirit Himself helps our weaknesses and intercedes through us to pray for what we truly need even though we do not know exactly how to pray (Romans 8:26).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Spiritual prayer is a powerful weapon of warfare against temptation (Ephesians 6:18). Jude admonished, &#8220;But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God&#8221; (Jude 20-21). Of course, it is not always possible to pray extensively at the moment of temptation. For this reason, it is important to have a consistent, strong prayer life at all times.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Second, we must engraft or implant the Word of God in our hearts so that we will obey His Word as a matter of course. </i>&#8220;Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls&#8221; (James 1:21, NKJV). We must absorb the Word until it becomes a very part of us. We can do this by hearing, reading, memorizing, and meditating upon the Word of God. &#8220;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night&#8221; (Psalm 1:1-2). &#8220;Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. . . . I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. . . . Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path&#8221; (Psalm 119:11, 16, 105).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_21"></a>When temptation comes, we can recall the Word and speak it in our hearts. At the moment sin presents itself we must immediately begin to meditate on the Word before there is time for anything else. Jesus overcame temptation by quoting the Word (Matthew 4:1-11).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Third, we must personalize the truth of God&#8217;s Word. </i>We must realize both our personal ability and our personal responsibility to obey God and resist sin. We must recognize that we died to sin. In the time of temptation, we must recall the principles of Romans 6:<i> know, reckon, yield.</i> We should remind ourselves, &#8220;I do not have to do this. I am a free person. I have the power of the Spirit available to me. I can resist this temptation to sin.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Fourth, we must not give the sinful nature any opportunities.</i> Instead, we must consciously avoid tempting or dangerous situations. We must not feed our fleshly desires by thinking, reading, watching, or indulging in things that would inflame those lusts. We must discipline the flesh and daily kill its desires. Basically, this means to cut off sinful thoughts and desires as they begin to develop. We must learn to think on good things (Philippians 4:8) and to make every thought obedient to Christ (II Corinthians 10:5). We must also learn to control all bodily appetites, for if we overindulge in physical appetites it will be more difficult to deny ourselves in other areas. Fasting is one good way to impose discipline on the physical body, not to punish it but to control it.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><i>Finally, we must train ourselves to develop proper habits of Christian living instead of sinful habits.</i> Developing good habits requires several things: repetition, commitment to consistency, diligence, refusal to make any exceptions, and refusal to get discouraged because of failure. We must learn to yield to God just as we formerly yielded to sin (Romans 6:13, 19). When we recognize and experience a scriptural prompting to do God&#8217;s will, we must visualize and meditate upon the desired <a id="page_22"></a>action, decide to do it, and then yield our bodily members to perform it.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b>Practical Applications Today</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness begins in the heart with attitudes and thoughts and extends to our way of life, behavior, appearance, and speech. We will briefly discuss some important areas in which biblical, and therefore universal and unchanging, principles of holiness apply.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Attitudes.</i></b> (See Galatians 5:19-23; Ephesians 4:23-32.) The essence of holiness is to bear the fruit of the Spirit, which includes love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. As Christians, we learn to forgive, obey authority, be thankful, not let anything offend us, and not be busybodies in others&#8217; lives. We put away evil attitudes such as hatred, malice, wrath, envy, jealousy, covetousness, bitterness, pride, prejudice, vengeance, strife, and discord. Holiness also includes justice and mercy in personal and social relationships.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Thoughts.</i></b> (See Matthew 15:18-20; II Corinthians 10:5; Philippians 4:8.) We are what we think, and we become what we allow our minds to dwell upon. We are to think on true, noble, just, pure, lovely, commendable, virtuous, and praiseworthy things. We cast out temptations and evil thoughts, taking every thought captive to obey Christ.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>The tongue.</i></b> (See Colossians 4:6; James 1:26; 3:1-2; 4:11; 5:12.) We employ wholesome, gracious speech. Thus, we avoid tale bearing, backbiting, slander, sowing discord, swearing by oath, using the Lord&#8217;s name in vain, pronouncing curses, reviling, lying, idle words, and suggestive, indecent, or obscene speech.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>The eye.</i></b> (See Psalm 101:2-3; 119:37; Matthew 6:22-23.) The eye is the gate of the soul and the primary source of input <a id="page_23"></a>for the mind. We guard ourselves against reading or viewing things that are sensual, vulgar, immoral, or saturated with violence. Because of the widespread display of evil in modern media, we must be particularly mindful of the dangers associated with television programming, movies, and the Internet.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Appearance (adornment, dress, and hair).</i></b> (See Deuteronomy 22:5; I Corinthians 11:1-16; I Timothy 2:8-10; I Peter 3:1-5.) The appearance reflects the inner self, both to God and to others. Worldly styles promote lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life, molding both wearer and society in ungodly ways. Biblical principles here include modesty, avoidance of personal ornamentation, moderation in cost, and distinction between male and female in dress and hair.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Stewardship of the body.</b> (See I Corinthians 3:16-17; 6:12, 19-20.) The body is the temple of the Spirit, so we promote moderation and stewardship in diet, exercise, and rest. We do not use things that harm or defile the body, cause intoxication, or cause addiction.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Sanctity of marriage.</b> (See I Corinthians 6:9-11; Colossians 3:5; Hebrews 13:4.) Marriage is the lifelong commitment of a man and a woman. Divorce is not God&#8217;s plan but is a result of human sin. Sexual relationships are wholesome in marriage but sinful outside of marriage. We are to guard against lustful thoughts and actions.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Sanctity of human life.</b> (See Exodus 20:13; Matthew 5:39, 44.) Humans were created in God&#8217;s image; thus, we seek to avoid violence and bloodshed. Abortion and assisted suicide are wrongful takings of human life.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Honesty.</b> (See Mark 10:19.) The Bible promotes integrity and rejects all dishonesty, including lying, theft, fraud, refusal to pay debts, extortion, bribery, and cheating.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Godly fellowship.</b> (See Matthew 18:15-18; I Corinthians 5:9-6:8; 15:33.) We need wholesome fellowship, unity in the church, mutual accountability, and mutual submission. We <a id="page_24"></a>should not associate closely with so-called believers who habitually indulge in sinful activities. We resolve internal disagreements within the church, not by secular lawsuits.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Worldly activities.</b> (See I Thessalonians 5:22; Titus 3:3; I John 2:15.) We conduct activities in a wholesome atmosphere and seek to be a godly example in everything. With this in mind, we maturely regulate amusements, music, sports, and games.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Retaliation.</b> The Bible expressly teaches against all forms of retaliation and vengeance (Matthew 5:38-48; Romans 12:17-21; I Peter 3:9). &#8220;Do not repay anyone evil for evil. . . . Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God&#8217;s wrath, for it is written: &#8216;It is mine to avenge; I will repay,&#8217; says the Lord&#8221; (Romans 12:17, 19, NIV).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Greed and Materialism.</b> Envy, jealousy, covetousness and greed are closely related evils. Covetousness and greed are basically synonymous terms, meaning an inordinate, unrestrained desire for wealth or possessions. This attitude is strongly condemned in both Testaments. &#8220;Thou shalt not covet&#8221; (Exodus 20:17). &#8220;Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man&#8217;s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth&#8221; (Luke 12:15). Covetousness is idolatry (Colossians 3:5).</p>
<p class="bodytext">Envy and jealousy consist of a grudging of another&#8217;s possessions or accomplishments together with a coveting of them. Jealousy often connotes an extreme desire to obtain or keep what we believe should be exclusively ours, while envy connotes an extreme desire to obtain what belongs to others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Bible&#8217;s rejection of these attitudes stands as an indictment of the materialism of our age. Materialism&#8212;preoccupation with material possessions&#8212;causes us to become soft, lazy, and discontented with what we have. In turn, this makes us reluctant to live sacrificially for Christ&#8217;s sake and highly susceptible to envy and jealousy.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_25"></a>The Bible&#8217;s teaching on this subject is very relevant to our society, for by the standards of the rest of the world and of history we in North America are wealthy. &#8220;For we brought nothing, into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content. But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. . . . Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share, storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life&#8221; (I Timothy 6:7-11; 17-19, NKJV).</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Prejudice.</b> The Bible teaches that every human being is of equal worth in the sight of God. God is no respecter of persons (Acts 10:34; Romans 2:11). In Christ, there is no unequal treatment based on race, social class, or gender (Galatians 3:28). Paul admonished Timothy to perform his pastoral duties without prejudice, partiality, or favoritism (I Timothy 5:21). If we discriminate against one group and show partiality to another, then we violate God&#8217;s Word. It is wrong to be prejudiced against someone because of race, social standing, lack of education, or poverty. &#8220;If ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin&#8221; (James 2:9). God &#8220;will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality&#8221; (Job 13:10, NKJV).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><b><a id="page_26"></a>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">God&#8217;s moral law for us can be summed up in these words: Love God with all your being and love your fellow human as yourself (Matthew 22:36-40; Mark 12:28-31; Romans 13:8-10). In essence, holiness means to imitate Christ, to do what He would do. It means to be Christ-like.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The power to live a holy life is a gift from God, but it is our responsibility to implement holiness on a daily basis. We seek holiness out of love for God, not out of fear or legalism.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Holiness is an integral part of the salvation of the whole person from sin&#8217;s power and effects. It is a joyful privilege; a part of abundant life; a blessing from God&#8217;s grace; a glorious life of freedom and power. The life of holiness fulfills God&#8217;s original intention and design for humanity. For the Spirit-filled believer who loves God, holiness is the normal&#8212;indeed the only&#8212;way to live.</p>
