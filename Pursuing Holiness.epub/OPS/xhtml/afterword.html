<p class="bodytext">The word<i> pursuit</i> indicates an ongoing attempt to attain something, and so it is in our effort to be holy. In every area of our lives, as we have studied throughout these diverse sessions, we must strive every day to let God&#8217;s holiness work in us and to abstain from sin&#8212;a commitment that affects how we think, speak, dress, treat our body, and treat others.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This effort must be bolstered with prayer as we ask the Lord to show us places inwardly and outwardly where we need to make adjustments to present ourselves more effectively as &#8220;a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God&#8221; (Romans 12:1). Also, we must spend time in the Word of God so it can guide us in how to make the needed changes in our lives and in how to make holy choices in our ever-changing world.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The word<i> pursuit</i> might also suggest something illusive about our effort to be holy. We understand after study, however, that we have clear Bible guidelines for living a life of holiness as we continue day in and day out to make decisions based on the principles of God&#8217;s Word. Should we fail, as is possible with our imperfect human nature, we have the confidence that our holy God is also a God of love, faithful to forgive (I John 1:9). Such hope should propel us all the more in our pursuit to live a life of holiness as worship unto Him&#8212; separation from sin unto our loving, holy God.</p>
